  abstract = {In this paper, an efficient numerical technique is developed to approximate the solution of two-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equations. The method is based on the nonsymmetric radial basis function collocation method (Kansa's method), within an operator Newton algorithm. In the proposed process, three-dimensional radial basis functions (especially, three-dimensional Multiquadrics (MQ) and Inverse multiquadrics (IMQ) functions) are used as the basis functions. For solving the resulting nonlinear system, an algorithm based on the Newton approach is constructed and applied. In the multilevel Newton algorithm, to overcome the instability of the standard methods for solving the resulting ill-conditioned system an interesting and efficient technique based on the Tikhonov regularization technique with GCV function method is used for solving the ill-conditioned system. Finally, the presented method is used for solving some examples of the governing problem. The comparison between the obtained numerical solutions and the exact solutions demonstrates the reliability, accuracy and efficiency of this method.},

  abstract = {Two approximate methods for solving the band-structure problem in an efficient and physically transparent way are presented and discussed in detail. The variational principle for the one-electron Hamiltonian is used in both schemes, and the trial functions are linear combinations of energy-independent augmented plane waves (APW) and muffin-tin orbitals (MTO), respectively. The secular equations are therefore eigenvalue equations, linear in energy. The trial functions are defined with respect to a muffin-tin (MT) potential and the energy bands depend on the potential in the spheres through potential parameters which describe the energy dependence of the logarithmic derivatives. Inside the spheres, the energy-independent APW is that linear combination of an exact solution, at the arbitrary but fixed energy Eν, and its energy derivative which matches continuously and differentiably onto the plane-wave part in the interstitial region. The energies obtained with the linear-APW method for the MT potential have errors of order (E−Ev)4. Similarly, the energy-independent MTO is that linear combination which matches onto that solution of the Laplace equation in the interstitial region which is regular at infinity. The energies obtained with the linear-MTO method have additional errors of order (E−Vmtz)2, arising from the interstitial region where the potential is Vmtz. The linear-APW (LAPW) method combines desirable features of the APW and OPW methods; it can treat d bands, the energy dependence of its pseudopotential is linear and, owing to the smoothness of the energy-independent APW at the spheres, non-MT contributions to the potential are included principally through their Fourier components. The linear-MTO (LMTO) method is particularly suited for closely packed structures and it combines desirable features of Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker, linear-combination-of-atomic-orbitals, and cellular methods; the secular matrix is linear in energy, the overlap integrals factorize as potential parameters and structure constants, the latter are canonical in the sense that they neither depend on the energy nor the cell volume and they specify the boundary conditions on a single MT or atomic sphere in the most convenient way. This method is very well suited for self-consistent calculations. The empty-lattice test is applied to the linear-MTO method and the free-electron energy bands are accurately reproduced. Finally, it is shown how relativistic effects may be included in both the LAPW and LMTO methods.}

  abstract = {The radial functions Pi in the nonrelativistic description of the electronic structure of atoms are solutions of eigenvalue equations. These equations are treated as two-point boundary value problems for bound one-electron states and can be solved to high accuracy with finite difference methods. For these numerical techniques the transformation to a suitable new radial variable is essential. The effects and consequences following from an arbitrary suitable variable transformation are studied in the most general way. Important results following from this general analysis are the extension of the range of application of the standard Numerov scheme and the outline for an algorithm of increased overall efficiency and reliability. Especially, the explicit use of transformed solution functions is shown to be unnecessary. Radial functions can be determined for arbitrary effective potentials resulting from the underlying theoretical description. It is demonstrated that all numerical results can be calculated to within a consistent numerical truncation error of order h4 in the grid point spacing. The approach can be extended to handle unbound one-electron states and is applicable in other fields, where differential equations of similar character occur, e.g., in the description of the vibration of a diatomic molecule. A similar analysis for relativistic electronic structure calculations for atoms will be given in Part II. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {The pairs of radial functions Pi and Qi, which are part of the four-component single-particle spinors in the relativistic description of the electronic structure of bound states of atoms, are usually determined as solutions of eigenvalue problems. The latter constitute two-point boundary value problems which involve coupled pairs of first-order ordinary radial differential equations. To introduce a suitable notation, the theory involved in relativistic electronic structure calculations for atoms is briefly reviewed, including a general treatment of arbitrary transformations for the radial variable. Such variable transformations must be specified then, either explicitly (by a transformation function) or implicitly (by the solution method itself), for any actual calculation, though initially the variable transformation is almost completely independent of the numerical method to be applied. We consider suitable transformation functions out of which an actual choice can be made within wide limits. In our approach, the resulting transformed radial differential equations are discretized then with finite-difference methods. Since the accuracy and efficiency of these methods is increased when a constant step size h between contiguous points (in the transformed variable) is used, it is only here where the careful choice of the variable transformation is important. The resulting system of linear equations is solved for the radial functions with standard linear algebra methods rather than “shooting” methods. The present work extends the general study of variable transformations, given recently for nonrelativistic electronic structure calculations in Part I, to the relativistic case. Important results following from the present work are (i) a discretization scheme for first-order ordinary differential equations similar to the well-known standard Numerov scheme used within the nonrelativistic framework, (ii) a consistent numerical algorithm with an overall truncation error of order h4, (iii) a method for handling effective potentials behaving singularly like r−1 at the origin (as encountered, e.g., when the atomic nucleus is represented by a pointlike charge density distribution), and, in connection with this last point, (iv) the avoidance of nonanalytic short-range behavior of the solutions to be obtained from the differential equations. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

A 37 (1988) 307–315]. We compare the performance of the ND and DKB methods by computing various properties of Cs atom: energies, hyperfine integrals, the parity-non-conserving amplitude of the 6s1/2−7s1/2 transition, and the second-order many-body correction to the removal energy of the valence electrons. We find that for a comparable size of the basis set the accuracy of both methods is similar for matrix elements accumulated far from the nuclear region. However, for atomic properties determined by small distances, the DKB method outperforms the ND approach. In addition, we present a strategy for optimizing the size of the basis sets by choosing progressively smaller number of basis functions for increasingly higher partial waves. This strategy exploits suppression of contributions of high partial waves to typical many-body correlation corrections.},

We prove that the proposed method keeps the energy conservation in the given discrete norm. Comparing with non–conservative schemes, our algorithm keeps higher stability. Meanwhile, an optimal error estimate for the proposed scheme is given by an error splitting technique. That is, we split the error into two parts, one from temporal discretization and the other from spatial discretization. First, by introducing a time–discrete system, we prove the uniform boundedness for the solution of this time–discrete system in some strong norms and obtain error estimates in temporal direction. With the help of the preliminary temporal estimates, we then prove the pointwise uniform boundedness of the finite element solution, and obtain the optimal L2–norm error estimates in the sense that the time step size is not related to spatial mesh size. Finally, numerical examples are provided to validate the convergence–order, unconditional stability and energy conservation.},

  abstract = {An alternative approach to the solution of the two-center electronic Schrödinger equation involving a finite-difference Newton-Raphson algorithm is described. The usual separation in confocal elliptical coordinates is employed leading to two coupled one-dimensional differential equations with split boundary conditions. The corresponding set of finite-difference equations, including the energy eigenvalue, separation constant, boundary conditions, and normalization conditions, are incorporated into a large system of nonlinear algebraic equations which is solved by means of a generalized Newton-Raphson iteration. The present algorithm is relatively simple and flexible. Solutions at one value of the nuclear separation can be easily tracked into solutions at other values. Also with a modification of the boundary conditions continuum states can be obtained as easily as bound states. As examples, calculations of the 2sσg bound state and a positive-energy continuum state of H2+ at a separation R = 5.0 AU are presented. Through the use of a generalized Richardson extrapolation an accuracy of eight significant figures has been achieved.},

  abstract = {A robust and general solver for the radial Schrödinger, Dirac, and Kohn–Sham equations is presented. The formulation admits general potentials and meshes: uniform, exponential, or other defined by nodal distribution and derivative functions. For a given mesh type, convergence can be controlled systematically by increasing the number of grid points. Radial integrations are carried out using a combination of asymptotic forms, Runge–Kutta, and implicit Adams methods. Eigenfunctions are determined by a combination of bisection and perturbation methods for robustness and speed. An outward Poisson integration is employed to increase accuracy in the core region, allowing absolute accuracies of 10−8 Hartree to be attained for total energies of heavy atoms such as uranium. Detailed convergence studies are presented and computational parameters are provided to achieve accuracies commonly required in practice. Comparisons to analytic and current-benchmark density-functional results for atomic number Z=1–92 are presented, verifying and providing a refinement to current benchmarks. An efficient, modular Fortran 95 implementation, dftatom, is provided as open source, including examples, tests, and wrappers for interface to other languages; wherein particular emphasis is placed on the independence (no global variables), reusability, and generality of the individual routines.

The employed method is based on Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobbato quadrature points. Using the pseudo-spectral differentiation matrices the problem is reduced to a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. However, this method is basically a spectral method, but a subdomain-in-time algorithm is used which yields a smaller nonlinear system to study long-time numerical behavior. Because the time-space pseudo-spectral method has spectral accuracy, we present numerical experiments which show high accuracy of this method for the variant nonlinear Schrödinger equations and also particular attention is paid to the conserved quantities as an indicator of the accuracy. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The scheme is implemented in a general fashion and can be used with various choices for the descriptions of the QM or MM regions. Tests on H2O clusters, ranging from dimer to decamer show that no systematic energy errors are introduced by the coupling that exceeds the differences in the QM and MM descriptions. Over 1 ns of liquid water, Born–Oppenheimer QM/MM molecular dynamics (MD) are sampled combining 10 parallel simulations, showing consistent liquid water structure over the QM/MM border. The method is applied in extensive parallel MD simulations of an aqueous solution of the diplatinum [Pt2(P2O5H2)4]4– complex (PtPOP), spanning a total time period of roughly half a nanosecond. An average Pt–Pt distance deviating only 0.01 Å from experimental results, and a ground-state Pt–Pt oscillation frequency deviating by {$<$}2\% from experimental results were obtained. The simulations highlight a remarkable harmonicity of the Pt–Pt oscillation, while also showing clear signs of Pt–H hydrogen bonding and directional coordination of water molecules along the Pt–Pt axis of the complex.}

Numerical calculations indicate that for a Coulomb potential, the basis set can be chosen in such a way that the variational eigenvalues satisfy a generalized Hylleraas-Undheim theorem. A number of relativistic sum rules are calculated to demonstrate that the variational solutions form a discrete representation of the complete Dirac spectrum including both positive-and negative-energy states. The results suggest that widely used methods for constructing L2 representations of the nonrelativistic electron Green's function can be extended to the Dirac equation. As an example, the relativistic basis sets are used to calculate electric dipole oscillator strength sums from the ground state, and dipole polarizabilities.}

  abstract = {Electronic structure calculations have become an indispensable tool in many areas of materials science and quantum chemistry. Even though the Kohn–Sham formulation of the density-functional theory (DFT) simplifies the many-body problem significantly, one is still confronted with several numerical challenges. In this article we present the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in the GPAW program package (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw) using a uniform real-space grid representation of the electronic wavefunctions. Compared to more traditional plane wave or localized basis set approaches, real-space grids offer several advantages, most notably good computational scalability and systematic convergence properties. However, as a unique feature GPAW also facilitates a localized atomic-orbital basis set in addition to the grid. The efficient atomic basis set is complementary to the more accurate grid, and the possibility to seamlessly switch between the two representations provides great flexibility. While DFT allows one to study ground state properties, time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) provides access to the excited states. We have implemented the two common formulations of TDDFT, namely the linear-response and the time propagation schemes. Electron transport calculations under finite-bias conditions can be performed with GPAW using non-equilibrium Green functions and the localized basis set. In addition to the basic features of the real-space PAW method, we also describe the implementation of selected exchange–correlation functionals, parallelization schemes, ΔSCF-method, x-ray absorption spectra, and maximally localized Wannier orbitals.},

  abstract = {Although B-spline techniques have been used to solve two-point boundary value problems with Dirac Hamiltonians for more than 20 years, the treatment of boundary conditions is still a matter of controversy. Spurious, non-physical, solutions are endemic when boundary conditions are not handled correctly. These pathological problems are absent when traditional finite difference methods are used as in computer packages such as GRASP. Accurate approximation using both finite differences and B-splines depends on controlling local approximation errors, and this common property suggests no a priori reason to suppose that B-spline algorithms should be more prone to generate spurious solutions. The relativistic Bloch operators of [24], when added to the Dirac differential operator, permit the construction of a self-adjoint differential operator for the two-point boundary value problem on a finite interval. Approximate solution of this problem exploiting the properties of B-splines in variational or Galerkin schemes is then straightforward. Although the analysis is presented primarily in terms of the Dirac R-matrix method for electron–atom scattering, it is also relevant to other applications such as relativistic atomic and molecular structure calculations, many-body perturbation calculations of structure and properties and relativistic dynamics.},

The fully relativistic Dirac R-matrix method has been less popular, but is becoming increasingly relevant for applications to heavy ion targets, where the need to use relativistic wavefunctions is more obvious. The Dirac R-matrix method has been controversial ever since it was first proposed by Goertzel (1948 Phys. Rev. 73 1463–6), and it is therefore important to confirm that recent elaborate and costly applications of the method, such as, Badnell et al (2004 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Phys. 37 4589) and Ballance and Griffin (2007 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 40 247–58), rest on secure foundations. The first part of this paper analyses the structure of the two-point boundary-value problem for the Dirac operator on a finite domain, from which we construct a unified derivation of the Schrödinger (nonrelativistic) and Dirac (relativistic) R-matrix methods. Suggestions that the usual relativistic theory is not well founded are shown to be without foundation.},

  abstract = {Several difficulties associated with the use of the Dirac operator in atomic and molecular structure calculations are analysed. The physical stability of the ground states of atoms and molecules requires the use of Dirac's 'hole' (positron) theory to prevent the decay of bound electrons into the lower continuum. Thus relativistic bound-state calculations for atoms or molecules can, in practice, more or less ignore the negative energy states. A rigorous theorem on the eigenvalue distribution in finite-basis-set variational calculations with one-body Dirac operators is presented, and its implications for many-body atomic or molecular systems are described. The theory shows that the basis sets must satisfy suitable boundary conditions to ensure acceptable results. The theory is illustrated with numerical studies of convergence to hydrogenic solutions using finite basis sets, and to closed-shell Dirac-Fock problems. In all cases, the bound-state variational energies are rigorous upper bounds. Finally, the author presents the first results of a calculation in which the Breit interaction has been included in the self-consistent field instead of being treated as a first-order perturbation.},

The special basis-set requirements for obtaining accurate molecular polarisabilities are discussed. The problem of achieving basis-set convergence is also considered. An approximation at the SCF level — the weak formulation or Galerkin method — is introduced to reduce the computational expense resulting from the use of large basis sets.

Such speedups are much higher than other similar works for this important class of material simulation codes on GPU clusters. The current achievement is obtained by (1) moving the calculation fully into the GPU; (2) adopting a new algorithm to reduce the data amount for MPI communication; and (3) using new GPU and CPU numerical libraries. We have also provided a detail quantitative analysis of the computational times for different physical systems and number of GPU units, which helps one to understand the challenges and bottlenecks of the PWP DFT simulations on GPU machines.

  abstract = {The kinetically and atomically balanced conditions have been extensively used in various basis-set expansion methods to remove the nonphysical spurious states appearing in the numerical calculation of the Dirac equation; however, they are generally not applicable for methods in discrete variable representation. In this paper we show that these conditions can be conveniently introduced into the generalized pseudospectral (GPS) method. Four types of balanced condition, the mono kinetic balance (MKB), dual kinetic balance, mono atomic balance (MAB), and dual atomic balance, are incorporated into the GPS method to eliminate the spurious states. Numerical calculations for a variety of bound states of H-like ions in point-charge models are compared with the analytical solutions to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the developed methods. The application to highly charged ions with extended nuclear models is performed to show the flexibility of the balanced GPS methods in practical atomic structure calculations. It is concluded that the MAB-GPS and MKB-GPS methods, which are both free of any spurious states, show better performance and simpler implementation than the others in solving the Dirac equation with the potential in point-charge and extended nuclear models, respectively. The balanced GPS methods developed in this paper provide a useful tool for accurately solving the one-electron Dirac equation and efficiently constructing the multielectron relativistic wave functions.}

It supports earlier non-block and block versions of codes as well as a new block version in which the njgraf library module [A. Bar-Shalom, M. Klapisch, Comput. Phys. Commun. 50 (1988) 375] has been replaced by the librang angular package developed by Gaigalas based on the theory of [G. Gaigalas, Z.B. Rudzikas, C. Froese Fischer, J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Phys. 30 (1997) 3747, G. Gaigalas, S. Fritzsche, I.P. Grant, Comput. Phys. Commun. 139 (2001) 263]. Tests have shown that errors encountered by njgraf do not occur with the new angular package. The three versions are denoted v1, v2, and v3, respectively. In addition, in v3, the coefficients of fractional parentage have been extended to j=9/2, making calculations feasible for the lanthanides and actinides. Changes in v2 include minor improvements. For example, the new version of rci2 may be used to compute quantum electrodynamic (QED) corrections only from selected orbitals. In v3, a new program, jj2lsj, reports the percentage composition of the wave function in LSJ and the program rlevels has been modified to report the configuration state function (CSF) with the largest coefficient of an LSJ expansion. The bioscl2 and bioscl3 application programs have been modified to produce a file of transition data with one record for each transition in the same format as in Atsp2K [C. Froese Fischer, G. Tachiev, G. Gaigalas, M.R. Godefroid, Comput. Phys. Commun. 176 (2007) 559], which identifies each atomic state by the total energy and a label for the CSF with the largest expansion coefficient in LSJ intermediate coupling.

Catalogue identifier of previous version: ADZL\_v1\_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 177 (2007) 597 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Prediction of atomic properties — atomic energy levels, oscillator strengths, radiative decay rates, hyperfine structure parameters, Landé gJ-factors, and specific mass shift parameters — using a multiconfiguration Dirac–Hartree–Fock approach. Solution method: The computational method is the same as in the previous Grasp2K [1] version except that for v3 codes the njgraf library module [2] for recoupling has been replaced by librang [3,4]. Reasons for new version: New angular libraries with improved performance are available. Also methodology for transforming from jj- to LSJ-coupling has been developed. Summary of revisions: New angular libraries where the coefficients of fractional parentage have been extended to j=9/2, making calculations feasible for the lanthanides and actinides. Inclusion of a new program jj2lsj, which reports the percentage composition of the wave function in LSJ. Transition programs have been modified to produce a file of transition data with one record for each transition in the same format as Atsp2K [C. Froese Fischer, G. Tachiev, G. Gaigalas and M.R. Godefroid, Comput. Phys. Commun. 176 (2007) 559], which identifies each atomic state by the total energy and a label for the CSF with the largest expansion coefficient in LSJ intermediate coupling. Updated to 64-bit architecture. A comprehensive user manual in pdf format for the program package has been added. Restrictions: The packing algorithm restricts the maximum number of orbitals to be ≤214. The tables of reduced coefficients of fractional parentage used in this version are limited to subshells with j≤9/2 [5]; occupied subshells with j{$>$}9/2 are, therefore, restricted to a maximum of two electrons. Some other parameters, such as the maximum number of subshells of a CSF outside a common set of closed shells are determined by a parameter.def file that can be modified prior to compile time. Unusual features: The bioscl3 program reports transition data in the same format as in Atsp2K [6], and the data processing program tables of the latter package can be used. The tables program takes a name.lsj file, usually a concatenated file of all the~.lsj transition files for a given atom or ion, and finds the energy structure of the levels and the multiplet transition arrays. The tables posted at the website http://atoms.vuse.vanderbilt.edu are examples of tables produced by the tables program. With the extension of coefficients of fractional parentage to j=9/2, calculations for the lanthanides and actinides become possible. Running time: CPU time required to execute test cases: 70.5~s.

  abstract = {Abstract. The Hartree–Fock eigenvalue problem governed by the 3D integro-differential operator is the basic model in ab initio electronic structure calculations. Several years ago the idea to solve the Hartree–Fock equation by a fully 3D grid based numerical approach seemed to be a fantasy, and the tensor-structured methods did not exist. In fact, these methods evolved during the work on this challenging problem. In this paper, our recent results on the topic are outlined and the black-box Hartree–Fock solver by tensor numerical methods is presented. The approach is based on the rank-structured calculation of the core hamiltonian and of the two-electron integrals tensor using the problem adapted basis functions discretized on n×n×n\$n\textbackslash times n\textbackslash times n\$ 3D Cartesian grids. The arising 3D convolution transforms with the Newton kernel are replaced by a combination of 1D convolutions and 1D Hadamard and scalar products. The approach allows huge spatial grids, with n3≃1015\$n\^3\textbackslash simeq 10\^\{15\}\$, yielding high resolution at low cost. The two-electron integrals are computed via multiple factorizations. The Laplacian Galerkin matrix can be computed “on-the-fly” using the quantized tensor approximation of O(logn)\$O(\textbackslash log n)\$ complexity. The performance of the black-box solver in Matlab implementation is compatible with the benchmark packages based on the analytical (pre)evaluation of the multidimensional convolution integrals. We present ab initio Hartree–Fock calculations of the ground state energy for the amino acid molecules, and of the “energy bands” for the model examples of extended (quasi-periodic) systems.},

Instead, we employ the agglomerated “grey-box” numerical computation of the corresponding six-dimensional integrals in the tensor-structured format which does not require analytical separability of the basis set. The point of our method is a low-rank tensor representation of arising functions and operators on an n×n×n Cartesian grid and the implementation of the corresponding multi-linear algebraic operations in the tensor product format. Linear scaling of the tensor operations, including the 3D convolution product, with respect to the one-dimension grid size n enables computations on huge 3D Cartesian grids thus providing the required high accuracy. The presented algorithm for evaluation of the exchange operator and a recent tensor method for the computation of the Coulomb matrix are the main building blocks in the numerical solution of the Hartree-Fock equation by the tensor-structured methods. These methods provide a new tool for algebraic optimization of the Galerkin basis in the case of large molecules.},

We apply the self-consistent field (SCF) iteration to the Galerkin discretization in a set of low separation rank basis functions that are solely specified by the respective values on a three-dimensional Cartesian grid. The approximation error is estimated by \$O(h\^3)\$, where \$h=O(n\^\{-1\})\$ is the mesh size of an \$n\textbackslash times n\textbackslash times n\$ tensor grid, while the numerical complexity to compute the Galerkin matrices scales linearly in \$n\textbackslash log n\$. We propose the tensor-truncated version of the SCF iteration using the traditional direct inversion in the iterative subspace scheme enhanced by the multilevel acceleration with the grid-dependent termination criteria at each discretization level. This implies that the overall computational cost scales almost linearly in the univariate problem size n. Numerical illustrations are presented for the all electron case of H\$\_2\$O and the pseudopotential case of CH\$\_4\$ and CH\$\_3\$OH molecules. The proposed scheme is not restricted to a priori given rank-1 basis sets, allowing analytically integrable convolution transform with the Newton kernel that opens further perspectives for promotion of the tensor-structured methods in computational quantum chemistry.}

This wrong “Schrödinger limit” is shown to be the main reason for the phenomenon known as “variational collapse.” After a short review of existing proposals to overcome the “variational collapse,” a systematic study of the possible ways to avoid it is given. All discussed approaches are analyzed in terms of various criteria that one wants to fulfill. The most promising approach consists of a free-particle Foldy–Wouthuysen (FW) transformation on operator level and a back transformation on matrix level (approaches C2 and C3). This implies a modification of the free-electron part of the matrix representation of the Dirac operator and leads to the correct Schrödinger limit (and if one wishes even the correct Pauli limit) in the same basis (and to the exact results for a complete basis). The potential energy is unchanged, which makes the application to n -electron systems straightforward. Projection of the Dirac operator to positive energy states does not remove the variational collapse unless this is done in a very special way.},

The most straightforward approximate Hamiltonian for interacting electrons is derived from quantum electrodynamics (QED) in Coulomb gauge with the neglect of transversal photons. This allows an exact (non-perturbative) decoupling of the electromagnetic field from the fermionic field. The electric interaction of the fermions is non-retarded and non-quantized. The quantization of the fermionic field leads to a polarizable vacuum. The simplest (but somewhat problematic) approximation is a no-pair projected theory with external-field projectors. The Dirac-Coulomb operator in configuration space (first quantization) is not acceptable, even if the Brown–Ravenhall disease is much less virulent than often claimed. Effects of transversal photons, such as the Breit interaction and renormalized self-interaction can be taken care of perturbatively at the end, but there are still many open questions.},

  abstract = {A comparison of DFT methods Density functional theory (DFT) is now routinely used for simulating material properties. Many software packages are available, which makes it challenging to know which are the best to use for a specific calculation. Lejaeghere et al. compared the calculated values for the equation of states for 71 elemental crystals from 15 different widely used DFT codes employing 40 different potentials (see the Perspective by Skylaris). Although there were variations in the calculated values, most recent codes and methods converged toward a single value, with errors comparable to those of experiment. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad3000; see also p. 1394 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONThe reproducibility of results is one of the underlying principles of science. An observation can only be accepted by the scientific community when it can be confirmed by independent studies. However, reproducibility does not come easily. Recent works have painfully exposed cases where previous conclusions were not upheld. The scrutiny of the scientific community has also turned to research involving computer programs, finding that reproducibility depends more strongly on implementation than commonly thought. These problems are especially relevant for property predictions of crystals and molecules, which hinge on precise computer implementations of the governing equation of quantum physics. RATIONALEThis work focuses on density functional theory (DFT), a particularly popular quantum method for both academic and industrial applications. More than 15,000 DFT papers are published each year, and DFT is now increasingly used in an automated fashion to build large databases or apply multiscale techniques with limited human supervision. Therefore, the reproducibility of DFT results underlies the scientific credibility of a substantial fraction of current work in the natural and engineering sciences. A plethora of DFT computer codes are available, many of them differing considerably in their details of implementation, and each yielding a certain “precision” relative to other codes. How is one to decide for more than a few simple cases which code predicts the correct result, and which does not? We devised a procedure to assess the precision of DFT methods and used this to demonstrate reproducibility among many of the most widely used DFT codes. The essential part of this assessment is a pairwise comparison of a wide range of methods with respect to their predictions of the equations of state of the elemental crystals. This effort required the combined expertise of a large group of code developers and expert users. RESULTSWe calculated equation-of-state data for four classes of DFT implementations, totaling 40 methods. Most codes agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Even in the case of pseudization approaches, which largely depend on the atomic potentials used, a similar precision can be obtained as when using the full potential. The remaining deviations are due to subtle effects, such as specific numerical implementations or the treatment of relativistic terms. CONCLUSIONOur work demonstrates that the precision of DFT implementations can be determined, even in the absence of one absolute reference code. Although this was not the case 5 to 10 years ago, most of the commonly used codes and methods are now found to predict essentially identical results. The established precision of DFT codes not only ensures the reproducibility of DFT predictions but also puts several past and future developments on a firmer footing. Any newly developed methodology can now be tested against the benchmark to verify whether it reaches the same level of precision. New DFT applications can be shown to have used a sufficiently precise method. Moreover, high-precision DFT calculations are essential for developing improvements to DFT methodology, such as new density functionals, which may further increase the predictive power of the simulations. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/351/6280/aad3000/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Recent DFT methods yield reproducible results.Whereas older DFT implementations predict different values (red darts), codes have now evolved to mutual agreement (green darts). The scoreboard illustrates the good pairwise agreement of four classes of DFT implementations (horizontal direction) with all-electron results (vertical direction). Each number reflects the average difference between the equations of state for a given pair of methods, with the green-to-red color scheme showing the range from the best to the poorest agreement. The widespread popularity of density functional theory has given rise to an extensive range of dedicated codes for predicting molecular and crystalline properties. However, each code implements the formalism in a different way, raising questions about the reproducibility of such predictions. We report the results of a community-wide effort that compared 15 solid-state codes, using 40 different potentials or basis set types, to assess the quality of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof equations of state for 71 elemental crystals. We conclude that predictions from recent codes and pseudopotentials agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Older methods, however, have less precise agreement. Our benchmark provides a framework for users and developers to document the precision of new applications and methodological improvements. A survey of recent density functional theory methods shows a convergence to more accurate property calculations.

  abstract = {All-electron electronic structure methods based on the linear combination of atomic orbitals method with Gaussian basis set discretization offer a well established, compact representation that forms much of the foundation of modern correlated quantum chemistry calculations—on both classical and quantum computers. Despite their ability to describe essential physics with relatively few basis functions, these representations can suffer from a quartic growth of the number of integrals. Recent results have shown that, for some quantum and classical algorithms, moving to representations with diagonal two-body operators can result in dramatically lower asymptotic costs, even if the number of functions required increases significantly. We introduce a way to interpolate between the two regimes in a systematic and controllable manner, such that the number of functions is minimized while maintaining a block-diagonal structure of the two-body operator and desirable properties of an original, primitive basis. Techniques are analyzed for leveraging the structure of this new representation on quantum computers. Empirical results for hydrogen chains suggest a scaling improvement from O(N4.5) in molecular orbital representations to O(N2.6) in our representation for quantum evolution in a fault-tolerant setting, and exhibit a constant factor crossover at 15 to 20 atoms. Moreover, we test these methods using modern density matrix renormalization group methods classically, and achieve excellent accuracy with respect to the complete basis set limit with a speedup of 1–2 orders of magnitude with respect to using the primitive or Gaussian basis sets alone. These results suggest our representation provides significant cost reductions while maintaining accuracy relative to molecular orbital or strictly diagonal approaches for modest-sized systems in both classical and quantum computation for correlated systems.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) has become ubiquitous for chemical applications in research and in education. The exact functional at the foundation of DFT is unfortunately unknown, and issues arise when choosing an approximation for a specific application. With this tutorial review, we tackle the selection problem and many related ones, such as the choices of a basis set and of an integration grid, that are often overlooked by occasional practitioners and by more experienced users as well. We offer a practical approach in the form of a commented notebook containing 12 experiences that can be run on a simple computer in just a few hours. We propose this review as a primary source for those who are willing to include DFT in their everyday research or teaching activities in a way that reflects the research advances of the field in the last couple of decades.},

  abstract = {A grid-based real-space implementation of the projector augmented wave (PAW) method of Blöchl [Phys. Rev. B 50, 17953 (1994)] for density functional theory (DFT) calculations is presented. The use of uniform three-dimensional (3D) real-space grids for representing wave functions, densities, and potentials allows for flexible boundary conditions, efficient multigrid algorithms for solving Poisson and Kohn-Sham equations, and efficient parallelization using simple real-space domain-decomposition. We use the PAW method to perform all-electron calculations in the frozen core approximation, with smooth valence wave functions that can be represented on relatively coarse grids. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by calculating the atomization energies of 20 small molecules, and the bulk modulus and lattice constants of bulk aluminum. We show that the approach in terms of computational efficiency is comparable to standard plane-wave methods, but the memory requirements are higher.}

  abstract = {We present a method that enables solid-state density functional theory calculations to be applied to systems of almost unlimited size. Computations of physical effects up to the micron length scale but which nevertheless depend on the microscopic details of the electronic structure, are made possible. Our approach is based on a generalization of the Bloch state, which involves an additional sum over a finer grid in reciprocal space around each k point. We show that this allows for modulations in the density and magnetization of arbitrary length on top of a lattice-periodic solution. Based on this, we derive a set of ultra-long-range Kohn-Sham equations. We demonstrate our method with a sample calculation of bulk LiF subjected to an arbitrary external potential containing nearly 3500 atoms. We also confirm the accuracy of the method by comparing the spin density wave state of bcc Cr against a direct supercell calculation starting from a random magnetization density. Furthermore, the spin spiral state of γ-Fe is correctly reproduced.}

Specifically, we utilize extrapolation at periodic intervals within the Jacobi iteration to develop the Alternating Anderson–Jacobi (AAJ) method. We verify the accuracy and efficacy of AAJ in a range of test cases, including nonsymmetric systems of equations. We demonstrate that AAJ possesses a favorable scaling with system size that is accompanied by a small prefactor, even in the absence of a preconditioner. In particular, we show that AAJ is able to accelerate the classical Jacobi iteration by over four orders of magnitude, with speed-ups that increase as the system gets larger. Moreover, we find that AAJ significantly outperforms the Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method in the range of problems considered here, with the relative performance again improving with size of the system. Overall, the proposed method represents a simple yet efficient technique that is particularly attractive for large-scale parallel solutions of linear systems of equations.},

  abstract = {Ab initio many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation is a Green’s function formalism widely used in the calculation of quasiparticle excitation energies of solids. In what has become an increasingly standard approach, Kohn–Sham eigenenergies, generated from a DFT calculation with a strategically-chosen exchange–correlation functional “starting point”, are used to construct G and W, and then perturbatively corrected by the resultant GW self-energy. In practice, there are several ways to construct the GW self-energy, and these can lead to variations in predicted quasiparticle energies. For example, for ZnO and TiO2, the GW fundamental gaps reported in the literature can vary by more than 1 eV depending on the GW code used. In this work, we calculate and analyze GW quasiparticle (QP) energies of these and other systems with three different GW codes: BerkeleyGW, Abinit and Yambo. Through a systematic analysis of the GW implementation of these three codes, we identify the primary origin of major discrepancies between codes reported in prior literature to be the different implementations the Coulomb divergence in the Fock exchange term and the frequency integration scheme of the GW self-energy. We then eliminate these discrepancies by using common numerical methods and algorithms, demonstrating that the same quasiparticle energies for a given material can be obtained with different codes, within numerical differences ascribable to the technical details of the underling implementations. This work will be important for users and developers in assessing the precision of future GW applications and methods.},

The block-diagonal form of the Hamiltonian no longer accounts for the coupling of both kinds of states. The positive-energy (‘electrons-only’) part can serve as a ‘fully’ relativistic electrons-only theory, which can be understood as a rigorous basis for chemistry. Recent developments of the Douglas–Kroll–Hess (DKH) method allowed to derive a sequence of expressions, which approximate this electrons-only Hamiltonian up to arbitrary-order. While all previous work focused on the numerical stability and accuracy of these arbitrary-order DKH Hamiltonians, conceptual issues and paradoxa of the method were mostly left aside. In this work, the conceptual side of DKH theory is revisited in order to identify essential aspects of the theory to be distinguished from purely computational consideration.},

  abstract = {The nonlinear logarithmic Schrödinger equation (log SE) appears in many branches of fundamental physics, ranging from macroscopic superfluids to quantum gravity. We consider here a model problem, in which the log SE includes an attractive Coulomb interaction. We derive an analytical solution for the ground state energy and wave function as a function of the strength of the logarithmic interaction. We develop an iterative finite element method to solve the Coulombic log SE for the spherically symmetric states. The ground state results agree with the exact solution to better than one part in 1010. The excited states (n{$>$}1) are converged to better than one part in 108. We also construct a remarkably simple variational wave function, consisting of a sum of Gaussons with n free parameters. One can obtain an approximation to the energy and wave function that is in good agreement with the finite element results. Although the Coulomb problem is interesting in its own right, the iterative finite element method and the variational Gausson basis approach can be applied to any central force Hamiltonian.},

  abstract = {Some form of the time-independent logarithmic Schrödinger equation (log SE) arises in almost every branch of physics. Nevertheless, little progress has been made in obtaining analytical or numerical solutions due to the nonlinearity of the logarithmic term in the Hamiltonian. Even for a central potential, the Hamiltonian does not commute with or the Hamiltonian is invariant under the parity operation only if the wave function is an eigenstate of the parity operator. We show that the solutions with well-defined parity can be expressed as a linear combination of eigenstates of and where the parity restrictions on and determine the nodal structure of the wave function. The dominant contribution in the sum is designated as and these serve as approximate quantum numbers. Using an iterative finite element approach, we also carry out fully converged numerical calculations in 1D, 2D and 3D for the special case of a Coulomb potential. The nodal structure of the wave functions and the expectation values and are consistent with the analytical predictions. Values for the energy and expectations values are tabulated for the low-lying states. The methods developed for this problem are applicable across many areas of physics.},

Examples such as semicore states participating in the chemical bond, extended valence states, or a significant charge transfer in alkali chlorides are presented. The need for the semiempirical choice of “suitable” atomic configuration in the pseudopotential generating process is eliminated and also the higher l-pseudopotential components are generated in a natural way. Also some general aspects of pseudopotential transferability are discussed in detail.}

Since the spatial error is \$\$\textbackslash tau \$\$-independent, the numerical solution can be bounded in \$\$L\^\{\textbackslash infty \}\$\$-norm by an inverse inequality unconditionally.

The focus was on advances in ab initio solid state calculations and their practical use in industry. The theoretical papers addressed three dominant themes, namely (i) more accurate total energies and electronic excitations, (ii) more complex systems, and (iii) more diverse and accurate materials properties. Hybrid functionals give some improvements in energies, but encounter difficulties for metallic systems. Quantum Monte Carlo methods are progressing, but no clear breakthrough is on the horizon. Progress in order-N methods is steady, as is the case for efficient methods for exploring complex energy hypersurfaces and large numbers of structural configurations. The industrial applications were dominated by materials issues in energy conversion systems, the quest for hydrogen storage materials, improvements of electronic and optical properties of microelectronic and display materials, and the simulation of reactions on heterogeneous catalysts. The workshop is a clear testimony that ab initio computations have become an industrial practice with increasingly recognized impact.},

Furthermore, a very general approach is presented for solving the Poisson equation, needed within density functional theory in order to achieve self-consistency. Special chapters are devoted to the Coherent Potential Approximation and to the Embedded Cluster Method, used, for example, for describing nanostructured matter in real space. In a final chapter, physical properties related to the (single-particle) Green's function, such as magnetic anisotropies, interlayer exchange coupling, electric and magneto-optical transport and spin-waves, serve to illustrate the usefulness of the methods described.},

  abstract = {Recently, we have proposed the adaptive local basis set for electronic structure calculations based on Kohn–Sham density functional theory in a pseudopotential framework. The adaptive local basis set is efficient and systematically improvable for total energy calculations. In this paper, we present the calculation of atomic forces, which can be used for a range of applications such as geometry optimization and molecular dynamics simulation. We demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, the computation of atomic forces can scale nearly linearly with the number of atoms in the system using the adaptive local basis set. We quantify the accuracy of the Hellmann–Feynman forces for a range of physical systems, benchmarked against converged planewave calculations, and find that the adaptive local basis set is efficient for both force and energy calculations, requiring at most a few tens of basis functions per atom to attain accuracies required in practice. Since the adaptive local basis set has implicit dependence on atomic positions, Pulay forces are in general nonzero. However, we find that the Pulay force is numerically small and systematically decreasing with increasing basis completeness, so that the Hellmann–Feynman force is sufficient for basis sizes of a few tens of basis functions per atom. We verify the accuracy of the computed forces in static calculations of quasi-1D and 3D disordered Si systems, vibration calculation of a quasi-1D Si system, and molecular dynamics calculations of H2 and liquid Al–Si alloy systems, where we show systematic convergence to benchmark planewave results and results from the literature.},
