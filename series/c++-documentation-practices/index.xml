Background In the previous post we generated documentation using Doxygen with Exhale to handle Sphinx. Now we will clean up the earlier workflow with rake and ensure the environment is reproducible with nix while deploying to Travis CI.
Setup A quick reminder of the setup we generated in the last post:
1tree -d $prj/ -L 2 . ├── docs │ ├── Doxygen │ └── Sphinx ├── nix │ └── pkgs ├── projects │ └── symengine └── scripts 8 directories We had further setup files to enable documentation generation with a manual two stage process (handling doxygen and sphinx separately).</description></item><item><title>Documenting C++ with Doxygen and Sphinx - Exhale</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/doc-cpp-dox-sph-exhale/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 06:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/doc-cpp-dox-sph-exhale/</guid><description>This post outlines a basic workflow for C++ projects using Doxygen, Sphinx, and Exhale.
Background My project proposal for documenting Symengine was recently accepted for the Google Summer of Docs initiative. In the past I have been more than happy to document C++ code using only Doxygen (with pretty fantastic results), while keeping example usage separate (d-SEAMS wiki). Though this is still a feasible method, a monolithic multi-project setup might benefit from Sphinx, which is what will be covered.</description></item></channel></rss>
