Unfortunately, the standard approach to work with this in nix deals with the local nixpkgs mechanism for python dependencies:
nix-shell -p &amp;#34;python38.withPackages(ps: [ ps.numpy ps.sh ])&amp;#34; However there is a catch for packages which are not officially present upstream.
# Fails! nix-shell -p &amp;#34;python38.withPackages(ps: [ ps.numpy ps.sh ps.lieer ])&amp;#34; However, the mach-nix project can indeed be used to work around this, at the cost of a somewhat longer command.</description></item><item><title>Snippets</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/snippets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 02:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/snippets/</guid><description>This collection consists of a series of snippets which are not particularly long enough or interesting enough to be a post.

A much better approach is to make a custom Dockerfile or even better, use nix.
However it does work in a pinch.

The sample problem here is running an HTTP server for viewing graphics in R via httpgd.

git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.8.1 The main reason to prefer asdf over competing language specific options like rvm or pyenv or nvm and company is simply uniformity of the interface. This can be coupled with zinit snippet OMZ::plugins/asdf for loading the completions. Note that the installation steps can take a while especially if openssl is being installed.</description></item><item><title>Watching Files</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/snippets/watch-files/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Sep 2021 17:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/snippets/watch-files/</guid><description>My personal favorite for watching files and running context sensitive commands is to use the lovely filewatcher CLI utility written in Ruby.
gem install filewatcher gem install filewatcher-cli This can then be used with:
filewatcher &amp;#39;**/*.js&amp;#39; &amp;#39;node $FILENAME&amp;#39; However this hasn&amp;rsquo;t been updated in a while now and fails on newer versions of Ruby. So now I use watchexec.

Host super Hostname super.machine.location.is IdentityFile ~/.ssh/mykey User myuser LocalForward 8001 localhost:8001 LocalForward 8002 localhost:8002 LocalForward 8003 localhost:8003 LocalForward 8004 localhost:8004 This is good for interactive sessions with multiple servers.
