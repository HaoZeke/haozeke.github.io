git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.8.1 The main reason to prefer asdf over competing language specific options like rvm or pyenv or nvm and company is simply uniformity of the interface. This can be coupled with zinit snippet OMZ::plugins/asdf for loading the completions. Note that the installation steps can take a while especially if openssl is being installed.</description></item><item><title>Snippets</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/snippets/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Sep 2021 17:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/snippets/</guid><description>This collection consists of a series of snippets which are not particularly long enough or interesting enough to be a post.

gem install filewatcher gem install filewatcher-cli This can then be used with:
filewatcher &amp;#39;**/*.js&amp;#39; &amp;#39;node $FILENAME&amp;#39; However this hasn&amp;rsquo;t been updated in a while now and fails on newer versions of Ruby. So now I use watchexec.

Introduction Bagging (or Bootstrap Aggregation) is one of the most commonly used ensemble method for improving the prediction of trees. We will broadly follow a historical development trend to understand the process. That is, we will begin by considering the Bootstrap method. This in turn requires knowledge of the Jacknife method, which is understandable from a simple bias variance perspective.</description></item><item><title>D3 for Git</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/d3git/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/d3git/</guid><description>Background I have had a lot of discussions regarding the teaching of git This is mostly as a part of the SoftwareCarpentries, or in view of my involvement with univ.ai, or simply in every public space I am associated with Without getting into my views, I just wanted to keep this resource in mind The site Learning git is a highly contentious thing People seem to be fond of GUI tools, especially since on non *nix systems, it seems that there is a lot of debate surrounding obtaining the git utility in the first place One of the best ways of understanding (without installing stuff) the mental models required for working with git is this site</description></item><item><title>Shorter Posts</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/shortpost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/shortpost/</guid><description>Background Sometime this year, I realized that I no longer have access to a lot of my older communication. This included, a lot of resources I enjoyed and shared with the people who were around me at that point in time. To counter this, I have decided to opt for shorter posts, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t always include the same level of detail I would prefer to provide.
Alternatives I have an automated system based around IFTTT combined with Twitter, Diigo, and even Pocket However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really tell me much, and trawling through a massive glut of data is often pointless as well There&amp;rsquo;s always Twitter, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really care to hear the views of others when I want to revisit my own ideas Conclusions I will be making shorter posts here, like the random one on octobox</description></item><item><title>Provisioning Dotfiles on an HPC</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/prov-dots/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/prov-dots/</guid><description>Background My dotfiles turned 4 years old a few months ago (since 9th Jan 2017) and remains one of my most frequently updated projects for obvious reasons. Going through the changes reminds me of a whole of posts I never got around to writing.
Anyway, recently I gained access to another HPC cluster, with a standard configuration (bash, old CentOS) and decided to track my provisioning steps. This is really a very streamlined experience by now, since I&amp;rsquo;ve used the same setup across scores of machines.</description></item><item><title>Switching to Colemak</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/colemak-switch/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Feb 2020 14:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/colemak-switch/</guid><description>Thoughts on and rationale behind leaving QWERTY and touch typing in general. Followed by this post on refactoring my Dotfiles.
Background I just realized that it has been over two years since I switched from QWERTY to Colemak but somehow never managed to write about it. It was a major change in my life, and it took forever to get acclimatized to. I do not think I&amp;rsquo;ll ever again be in a position to make such a change in my life again, but it was definitely worth it.</description></item><item><title>Bojack Horseman</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/bojack-horseman/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 22:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/bojack-horseman/</guid><description>Background For a while I was worried about writing about a TV show here. I thought it might be frivolous, or worse, might outweigh the other kinds of articles I would like to write. However, like most things, that which is ignored just grows, so it is easier to just write and forget about it.
The Show Much has been said about how Bojack Horseman is one of the best shows ever, and they&amp;rsquo;re all correct.</description></item><item><title>ISLR :: Moving Beyond Linearity</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/islr-ch7/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2020 09:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/islr-ch7/</guid><description>Chapter VII - Moving Beyond Linearity All the questions are as per the ISL seventh printing of the First edition1.
