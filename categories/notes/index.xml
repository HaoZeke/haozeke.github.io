Introduction Bagging (or Bootstrap Aggregation) is one of the most commonly used ensemble method for improving the prediction of trees. We will broadly follow a historical development trend to understand the process. That is, we will begin by considering the Bootstrap method. This in turn requires knowledge of the Jacknife method, which is understandable from a simple bias variance perspective.</description></item><item><title>D3 for Git</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/d3git/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/d3git/</guid><description>Background I have had a lot of discussions regarding the teaching of git This is mostly as a part of the SoftwareCarpentries, or in view of my involvement with univ.ai, or simply in every public space I am associated with Without getting into my views, I just wanted to keep this resource in mind The site Learning git is a highly contentious thing People seem to be fond of GUI tools, especially since on non *nix systems, it seems that there is a lot of debate surrounding obtaining the git utility in the first place One of the best ways of understanding (without installing stuff) the mental models required for working with git is this site</description></item><item><title>Shorter Posts</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/shortpost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/shortpost/</guid><description>Background Sometime this year, I realized that I no longer have access to a lot of my older communication. This included, a lot of resources I enjoyed and shared with the people who were around me at that point in time. To counter this, I have decided to opt for shorter posts, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t always include the same level of detail I would prefer to provide.
Alternatives I have an automated system based around IFTTT combined with Twitter, Diigo, and even Pocket However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really tell me much, and trawling through a massive glut of data is often pointless as well There&amp;rsquo;s always Twitter, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really care to hear the views of others when I want to revisit my own ideas Conclusions I will be making shorter posts here, like the random one on octobox</description></item><item><title>Taming Github Notifications</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/ghnotif/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2020 11:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/ghnotif/</guid><description>Background As a member of several large organizations, I get a lot of github notifications. Not all of these are of relevance to me. This is especially true of psuedo-monorepo style repositories like the JOSS review system and especially the exercism community.
I recently (re-)joined the exercism community as a maintainer for the C++ lessons after having been a (sporadic) teacher This was largely in response to a community call to action as the group needed new blood to usher in v3 of the exercism project Anyway, I have since found that at the small cost of possibly much of my public repo data, I can manage my notifications better with Octobox</description></item></channel></rss>
