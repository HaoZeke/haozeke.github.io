Followed by this post on refactoring my Dotfiles.
Background I just realized that it has been over two years since I switched from QWERTY to Colemak but somehow never managed to write about it. It was a major change in my life, and it took forever to get acclimatized to. I do not think I&amp;rsquo;ll ever again be in a position to make such a change in my life again, but it was definitely worth it.</description></item><item><title>Bojack Horseman</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/bojack-horseman/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 22:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/bojack-horseman/</guid><description>Background For a while I was worried about writing about a TV show here. I thought it might be frivolous, or worse, might outweigh the other kinds of articles I would like to write. However, like most things, that which is ignored just grows, so it is easier to just write and forget about it.
The Show Much has been said about how Bojack Horseman is one of the best shows ever, and they&amp;rsquo;re all correct.</description></item><item><title>Pandora and Proxychains</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/pandora-proxychains/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2020 05:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/pandora-proxychains/</guid><description>Background Pandora doesn&amp;rsquo;t work outside the states I keep forgetting how to set-up proxychains Proxychains Technically this article expects proxychains-ng, which seems to be the more up-to-date fork of the original proxychains.
Install proxychains-ng
# I am on archlinux.. sudo pacman -S proxychains-ng Copy the configuration to the $HOME directory
cp /etc/proxychains.conf . Edit said configuration to add some US-based proxy
In my particular case, I don&amp;rsquo;t keep the tor section enabled.</description></item><item><title>Site Rationale</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/rationale/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2020 23:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/rationale/</guid><description>Why this site exists I have a lot of online presences. I have been around (or at-least, lurking) for over ten years. Almost as long as I have been programming. Anyway, I have a penchant lately for using emacs and honestly there isn&amp;rsquo;t very good support for org-mode files. There are options recently with gatsby as well, but this seemed kinda neat.
What &amp;lsquo;this&amp;rsquo; is This site is built by Hugo The posts are generated with ox-hugo The theme is based of this excellent one by Djordje Atlialp, which in turn is based off of this theme by panr My modifications are here What is here Mostly random thoughts I don&amp;rsquo;t mind people knowing Some tech stuff which isn&amp;rsquo;t coherent enough to be put in any form with references Emacs specific workflows which I might want to write about more than short notes on the config What isn&amp;rsquo;t here Some collections should and will go to my grimoire My doom-emacs configuration Academic stuff is better tracked on Publons or Google Scholar or my pages hosted by my favorite IITK group or UI group</description></item></channel></rss>
