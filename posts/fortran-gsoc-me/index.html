<a href=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5790375215628288>accepted project
proposal</a>.
However, interestingly, it was an offhand comment at a <a href=https://www.cecam.org/lectures-categories/cecam-marvel-classics>CECAM MARVEL
Classics
webinar</a>
on free energy of solids <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> which triggered this.</p><h2 id=before-fortran-dot-dot>Before Fortran..</h2><p>Formula translation, or FORTRAN was not my first programming language. I
grew up with the Logo turtle, and progressed naturally into C for
coursework (as was the tradition back during my schooldays) and C++ for
monkeying around with my Xperia devices (mostly Cyanogenmod stuff, some
LineageOS). I shifted rather awkwardly in and out of Java (also a
popular mainstay in different schools) and decided at some point during
high school to pick up a high level language. I choose Ruby, because it
was cuter than Python (still is!) and I had just been bitten by the
web-design bug (Jekyll!!! Ruby on Rails!).</p><p>I was not unaware of Fortran, but I had little to no inclination to
learn it, at the time, in my youth I was only interested in systems
programming, web-design and other practical, visual activities.</p><h2 id=towards-fortran>Towards Fortran</h2><p>As I grew older, my interest in crass physical things waned and my
interest in the cool, calculating and sly discipline of simulation;
fortune telling with confidence and code kept pace.</p><p>I <strong>almost</strong> came into contact with Fortran when I mistakenly stumbled
onto <a href=http://www.quantum-espresso.org/>Quantum Espresso</a> in the course
of my first summer undergraduate research project under Prof. Rajarshi
Chakrabarti at IIT Bombay back in 2014&mldr;.</p><p>Almost, but not quite, for I was hunting models for soft matter
(eventually found them too Theeyancheri et al.
(<a href=#ref-theeyancheriTranslationalRotationalDynamics2020>2020</a>) ), and
<a href=https://espressomd.org/wordpress/about/features/>EsPReSSO MD</a> <strong>is
not</strong> Quantum Espresso.</p><h2 id=first-encounter>First Encounter</h2><p>I finally stumbled upon FORTRAN in all its free form <code>f90</code> glory in the
form of <a href=https://bigdft.org/>BigDFT</a> during my stint in the 2015
Students-Undergraduate Research Graduate Excellence (SURGE) program of
IIT Kanpur. A mere six years ago.</p><p>By then I had been programming, as perhaps many do, largely on the
largess of the internet. It was my source of information, and even
seeded some of my opinions. I immediately set out to discover as much
about Fortran as I could. Back then I failed miserably. For the first
time, I was confronted only with ridiculously ugly <code>F77</code> code examples,
and it seemed abundantly evident that most questions and projects were
clearly related to coursework (poorly taught coursework no less).</p><p>The only ray of sunshine in a mess of poor content was Ondřej Čertík&rsquo;s
<a href=https://www.fortran90.org/>fortran90.org</a>. I knew better than to write
off Fortran though, I knew even then its pedigree (impossible to
configure <a href=https://github.com/lammps/lammps>LAMMPS</a> without touching
upon <a href=http://www.netlib.org/blas/>BLAS</a> and
<a href=http://performance.netlib.org/lapack/>LAPACK</a>&mldr;) <sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>.</p><p>I was not a chemist, and my dealings with elegant EsPReSSo and LAMMPS in
no way prepared me for the horrific mess which was (and is) the codes of
ab-initio chemistry. I was however, introduced to Redwine
(<a href=#ref-redwineUpgradingFortran901995>1995</a>) .</p><h2 id=fortran-the-stable>Fortran the stable</h2><p>During my third year, I attempted to submit a project written in Julia.
I spent the next couple of months convincing the instructor of the fact
that Julia was a legitimate language and not a figment of my
imagination. Little wonder then, when the time came to submit an
undergraduate thesis, much of the computations were was inspired by the
venerable Fortran codes of Kayode
(<a href=#ref-kayodeFortranProgramsChemical1995>1995</a>) .</p><h2 id=ice-fire-and-fortran>Ice, Fire and Fortran</h2><p>The fortunate circumstances behind my position here in Iceland, are best
left to other posts. One of my tasks, was the migration of existing code
for the Single Center Multipole Expansion water model Wikfeldt et al.
(<a href=#ref-wikfeldtTransferableH2OInteraction2013>2013</a>) from Fortran (free
form, but not modern) to <code>C++</code> or at-least to write <code>ISO_C_BINDING</code>
wrappers for incorporation into existing <code>C++</code> libraries (with an eye
towards LAMMPS integration). At the time, given my projects in <code>C++</code>
(<a href=#ref-goswamiDSEAMSDeferredStructural2020>Goswami, Goswami, and Singh
2020</a>) and passable
familiarity with Fortran, this seemed like an optimal use of time.</p><p>However, the force-field was and remains to be heavily under development
Jónsson et al. (<a href=#ref-jonssonTransferablePotentialFunction2020>2020</a>),
Jónsson, Dohn, and Jónsson
(<a href=#ref-jonssonPolarizableEmbeddingTransferable2019>2019</a>), which made
anything less than a hard fork unfeasible. Still on the books however,
<strong>another Fortran project</strong> to look forward to!</p><h2 id=quantum-chemistry-and-fortran>Quantum Chemistry and Fortran</h2><p>With collaborators at SURFSara I was involved in the port from MATLAB to
C++, Gaussian Process Regression models Koistinen et al.
(<a href=#ref-koistinenNudgedElasticBand2019>2019</a>), Koistinen et al.
(<a href=#ref-koistinenNudgedElasticBand2017>2017</a>), Koistinen et al.
(<a href=#ref-koistinenMinimumModeSaddle2020>2020</a>), Koistinen
(<a href=#ref-koistinenAlgorithmsFindingSaddle2019>2019</a>) for accelerating
saddle searches and coupling said methodologies to EON Chill et al.
(<a href=#ref-chillEONSoftwareLong2014>2014</a>) for long time scales. This was
under my brilliant advisor&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.reaxpro.eu/>ReaxPro project</a>
who also guided and encouraged me towards applying for a fellowship. As
befitting a multiscale modeling project, this lead to an NDA and tweaks
towards efficient workflows using potentials from the <a href=https://www.scm.com/>Amsterdam
Modeling Suite</a>, which naturally, is <strong>written in
Fortran</strong>.</p><h2 id=tensors-ipam-and-fortran>Tensors, IPAM and Fortran</h2><p>Much <a href="https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/t/why-abandon-fortran-for-linear-algebra/1191/6?u=rgoswami">has been
said</a>
about <a href=https://www.nwchem-sw.org>NWChem</a>&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.hpcwire.com/2021/04/29/nwchemex-computational-chemistry-code-for-the-exascale-era/>pivot
towards</a>
<code>C++</code>. However, this has quite a bit to do with
<a href=https://github.com/pnnl/HiParTI>HiParTI</a> (a tensor library) being in
<code>C++</code>. To throw away Fortran simply because Tensors are as yet easier to
implement in other languages is treating a symptom, not fixing the
cause. In any case, over the course of an <a href="http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/tensor-methods-and-emerging-applications-to-the-physical-and-data-sciences/?tab=participant-list">IPAM
fellowship</a>
(supported by my advisor) I was able to gain a broad overview of the
underlying numerical complaints driving the schism; and there are
already fantastic libraries which can be leveraged for multilinear
algebra. Fortran is still one of the only language to have standardized
parallel programming paradigms, and in the long run there is no way that
won&rsquo;t count in its favor.</p><h2 id=fortran-lang-and-lfortran>Fortran Lang and LFortran</h2><p>Around the same time frame, I was lucky enough to be involved in the
documentation for <a href=https://symengine.org>SymEngine</a>, and from there I
was poised to witness the rapid rejuvenation and development of the
Fortran ecosystem spearheaded in no small part by Ondřej Čertík (a
fantastic person, mentor, and scientist; conversant in both algorithmic
topics and quantum chemistry). <code>LFortran</code> is perhaps the most
path-breaking of all the existing drives to fight the perceived
obsolesce of Fortran. By bringing interactivity to the masses, the
natural beauty of Fortran (recently reaffirmed by <a href=https://milancurcic.com/book/>Milan Curic&rsquo;s
book</a>) can come to the fore.</p><p>The Google Summer of Code project blends both my deep rooted interest in
language semantics and flexible implementations; while also whetting my
academic appetite by being so closely tied to the topics I love. Working
on <code>dftatom</code> (and related quantum chemistry codes) while gaining
familiarity with the LLVM based LFortran is fantastic. Being able to
work closely with the <a href=https://fortran-lang.org/newsletter/2021/05/18/Welcome-GSoC-students/>rest of the team behind Fortran
lang</a>
to bring about an &ldquo;age of Fortran, as promised twenty years ago&rdquo; is one
of the most exciting premises I can imagine.</p><h2 id=conclusions>Conclusions</h2><p>The picture painted here, like all nostalgic reminisces, is colored and
deeply biased. My love for modern <code>C++</code> and elegant <code>R</code>, my forays into
other languages, none of these are mentioned. The sheer <strong>joy</strong> of using
modern Fortran, of projects with <code>fpm</code>; is lost in translation. It is
true, that my work, has more often involved production level <code>C++</code> over
Fortran, however, given everything, I can be certain of one thing:</p><blockquote><p>The future is Fortran! (Or at-least involves a lot of Fortran)</p></blockquote><h2 id=references>References</h2><div id=refs class="references csl-bib-body hanging-indent"><div id=ref-chillEONSoftwareLong2014 class=csl-entry><p>Chill, Samuel T, Matthew Welborn, Rye Terrell, Liang Zhang, Jean-Claude
