A grades. They are successful, enthusiastic, and curious. By the time they
leave, only one third still receive straight As. The other two thirds get lower
grades, do not enjoy their studies, and are not fun to teach. Is Camwick
University a success? Camwick could point to its excellent teaching assessment
scores and argue that it is ‘adding value’: students emerge knowing more. Future
employers love the University’s policy of assigning grades – the University
ranks its students, saving companies the bother of assessing job applicants
themselves. But should a University be a sorting service? Isn’t something wrong
with an institution that takes in mainly A-quality input and turns out less than
half A-quality output? If a University fails to turn out as much A-quality
enthusiasts as come in, is it in fact a place of intellectual <strong>destruction</strong>,
throwing away the potential of the majority of its students? What are the roots
of this destruction?</p><h3 id=exams>Exams</h3><p>I would recommend that Camwick consider abolishing traditional exams. In the
current system, Camwick teaches Anna, Bob, and Charlie, who are all smart, then
examines them; Anna comes &rsquo;top&rsquo;, Bob &lsquo;second&rsquo; and Charlie &rsquo;third&rsquo;. Perhaps
Charlie, given a little more time, would have figured out the material, but he
wasn&rsquo;t quite ready when the exam arrived - perhaps because other courses
consumed his attention.</p><p>Bob&rsquo;s response to his &lsquo;failure&rsquo; is to adopt strategies of tlittle educational
value: he parrot learns, he crams, and he asks lecturers to tell him what&rsquo;s
going to be on the exam. The exams become the focus of attention, even though
the purpose of Bob&rsquo;s going to the University was learning.</p><p>Charlie&rsquo;s response is to give up on doing &lsquo;well&rsquo;, and coast through University,
no longer understanding everything. He loses self-worth and resents the
University for making him feel bad.</p><p>Some courses at Camwick assign grades using continuous assessment instead of
exams. But continuous assessment has the same effect as exams on Bob and
Charlie. So course grades based on continuous assessment should be abolished at
the same time as exams.</p><figure><img src=/macKayAs/fig1.jpg alt="Figure 1: Everyone can get an A, regardless of learning rate, if their education is not halted by exams. Traditional system on the left, with an educational system on the right."><figcaption><p><span class=figure-number>Figure 1: </span>Everyone can get an A, regardless of learning rate, if their education is not halted by exams. Traditional system on the left, with an educational system on the right.</p></figcaption></figure><p>If Camwick had no exams, the focus of attention would have to be elsewhere. How
about education, for example? Students could spend their time at Camwick
exploring subjects that interest them, and attending classes that offer
something they want to know about, free from the stress and misdirection of the
exam system. Lecturers would at all times be friends rather than adversaries.
[When I was an undergraduate at Cambridge, I asked a physis lecturer to clarify
topic \(N\), which I felt had not been covered clearly. His response: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what I love about \(N\): some students get it, some don&rsquo;t - so we get beautiful
bell shaped curves in the exam.&rdquo;]</p><p>Of course the extreme suggestion of abolishing all exams will not go down well:
&ldquo;What about standards?&rdquo; &ldquo;How can we get funding if we do not&rdquo; &ldquo;How do we award
degrees that people will respect?&rdquo; Traditionalists might say that students
appreciate exams for the targets and feedback. Well, there&rsquo;s nothing to stop us
giving students targets or feedback. We can provide events just like exams, if
students want them - self-administered tests, for example, would allow students
to check how well they have assimilated all the material in a course. Other
systems of targets and feedback that students enjoy include project work,
problem-based learning, and portfolio-based assessment.</p><p>As a compromise, let&rsquo;s modify our proposal a little: <strong>Camwick should become a place where the only achievable grade is an A.</strong> I&rsquo;m not recommending that we
simply give everyone an A. It&rsquo;s a crime to let standards slip. When I say
everyone should get an A, I mean that everyone should be allowed to get <em>to</em> an
A.</p><p>Think back to Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice grasped most of the material in the
course and achieved an A. Given a little more time and little less stress, Bob
and Charlie could probably have grasped it all too, and become equally strong
masters of the material. What good does it do Bob and Charlie to record the fact
that they were a little slower than alice? Wouldn&rsquo;t it have been better,
educationally, to give Bob and Charlie a little more time and help, so that they
achieved the same A standard?</p><p>Does a bus-driver-training school <em>rank</em> its graduating drivers? No, it ensures
that all attain the standard required of a bus-driver. Would you like to be
treated by a C-grade doctor? No, everyone wants an A-grade doctor! So doctors
and drivers are (I hope!) trained and trained and not let out until they are
A-grade in standard. Why should other professions be treated differently?</p><p>Figure 1a shows the command of the material of each student as a function of
time in the traditional system. A traditional exam interrupts the learning
process, and Bob and Charlie are recorded as having achieved a lower standard.
Figure 1b shows the same students in an exam-free system, assuming they learn at
the same rate as in the old system. Each student takes a different time to
achieve full command of the course material. Every student has the satisfaction
of achieving full command of the material.</p><figure><img src=/macKayAs/fig2.jpg alt="Figure 2: Everyone can get an A, regardless of learning rate, if their education is not halted by exams. Traditional system on the left, with an educational system on the right."><figcaption><p><span class=figure-number>Figure 2: </span>Everyone can get an A, regardless of learning rate, if their education is not halted by exams. Traditional system on the left, with an educational system on the right.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The difference between the two systems is also striking if we assume that
students start the course at different levels of ability. In Figure 2, albert
comes from a privileged background and already knows half the course material
when he arrives. Brenda and Catharine arrive at a lower educational level.
Brenda and Catharine are actually faster learners than Albert, but, as Figure 2a
shows, the traditional exam system rewards Albert with the A grade
(&lsquo;congratulations, you started first!&rsquo;), and brands Brenda and Catharine
failures. In the &lsquo;Only A-grades&rsquo; system, everyone attains an A-grade in due
course; and Albert isn&rsquo;t actually first to finish.</p><p>The information about &lsquo;who finished when&rsquo; could in principle be retained in
order to provide some sort of student-ranking service to employers, but I would
strongly urge the destruction of all such records. Only the achieving of an A
grade should be recorded, nothing else. Why?</p><ol><li>Because being ranked creates stress.</li><li>Because students who are competing with each other for ranks may be reluctant
to help each other learn. In contrast, in the &lsquo;Only A-grades&rsquo; system, the top
students lose nothing if they help their peers; indeed, they may gain in
several ways: peer-teaching strengthens the students&rsquo; grasp on material, and
often speeds up the whole class.</li><li>Evidence that a student is a quick learner may well make itself evident in
her transcript without rankings being made: Alice, covering material quickly,
will have time to take extra courses. So in one year she&rsquo;ll accumulate a
slightly fatter sheaf of A-grade qualifications.</li><li>What value are rankings? If future employers want students to be formally
evaluated, they can pay for an evaluation service. Why ruin a great
institution? The very best students might like grades too, as they enjoy
being congratulated. But the &lsquo;only A-grades&rsquo; system will congratualte them
too.</li></ol><p>These ideas are not new, nor are they unprecedented. In many German
Universities, first- and second-year courses have no grades, no obligatory
coursework, and no obligatory exams. End-of-course exams are provided only as a
service to students, to help them find out if they have indeed grasped the
material and are ready progress to the next stage.</p><p>In practice, how should we organize courses so that everyone reaches 100%
mastery? For Bob and Charlie&rsquo;s benefit, the average pace probably has to be
reduced. Figure 3 shows one way of organizing the material in stages, so that a
class is kept together. Whenever Alice has completed the material in a stage,
she can spend time on other interests, or can help other members of the class.</p><figure><img src=/macKayAs/figs_ABC21.jpg alt="Figure 3: Possible course plan. This scheme assumes that the students have rates of progress ranging from A (fastest) to C (slowest). Every two weeks, a consolidation period is inserted to ensure that C has assimilated all the learning objectives. Alice can use the consolidation period to pursue others interests or act as a peer-teacher."><figcaption><p><span class=figure-number>Figure 3: </span>Possible course plan.

Every two weeks, a consolidation period is inserted to ensure that C has assimilated all the learning objectives. Alice can use the consolidation period to pursue others interests or act as a peer-teacher.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Camwick staff who say &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t possibly cover a full degree course if we reduce
the pace!&rdquo; should bear in mind that, had Bob and charlie gone to a less
prestigious University, they probably would have got first-class degrees. How
can this paradox - going slowing and arriving at almost the same time - be
explained? I suspect an important factor is this: struggling students get ever
slower if we pile on new material before they have assimilated the old. For
example, 2ⁿᵈ-year Lagrangian dynamics is difficult to absorb if one hasn&rsquo;t
grasped 1ˢᵗ-year Newtonian dynamics. So the steady linear progress assumed in
Figures 1 to 3 is a poor model of Carlie. The more Charlie is left behind, the
slower he learns. This means that the true difference in pace between Alice and
Charlie need not be very big. If Charlie gets lost and left behind, we are
wasting everyone&rsquo;s time by having him sit in classes where new material is
presented. A stitch in time saves nine (Figure 4).</p><figure><img src=/macKayAs/figs_ABC31.jpg alt="Figure 4: A stitch in time saves nine. Curve C shows Charlie&amp;rsquo;s progress in a course taught at the pace that is ideal for Alice. The more Charlie is left behind, the slower he learns. By the end of the course, there is a big gap between A and C. Curve C′ shows Charlie&amp;rsquo;s progress in a course taught at the pace that is ideal for him. Just a small decrease in class pace allows the big gap between Alice and Charlie to be eliminated."><figcaption><p><span class=figure-number>Figure 4: </span>A stitch in time saves nine.

Just a small decrease in class pace allows the big gap between Alice and Charlie to be eliminated.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Teaching methods must be modified to ensure that everyone in the class benefits.
I advocate interactive teaching: students are asked questions and encouraged to
ask questions and to be active participants in their own learning. It&rsquo;s not
enough to ask a question and let one person in the class (Alice!) answer it. The
whole class must have the chance to think, puzzle and discuss; the teacher must
ascertain the level of understanding of the whole class. In large classes, I
find Mazur&rsquo;s voting method works well: a lecture is centered on two or three
carefully chosen questions with multiple-choice answers. Students discuss a
question with their neighbors, then all vote. The vote informs the lecturer
whether previous material has been understood. Diversity of votes can seed a
useful discussion.</p><p>To conclude, here are a few further advantages of the educational approach
advocated here:</p><ul><li>Happy, curious, and self-motivated students are fun to teach.</li><li>At present, British students have little choice of university teaching and
assessment style: all universities give out grades. Shouldn&rsquo;t we offer them a
choice? Some students would like the chance to go to a place with high
standards where only A-grades are awarded.</li><li>If some universities adopt student-centered educational policies and stop
ranking students, perhaps these attitudes will spread to schools, with
consequent benefits to pupils, and in due course, to universities. Dumbed-down
A levels could be replaced by educational programmes that ensure that everyone
attains their maximum potential and feels happy about it.</li><li>Happy graduates who get A grades are likely to become grateful alumni donors.</li></ul><div class=footnotes
