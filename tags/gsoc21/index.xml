Background As discussed in a previous post in this series, I have been spending roughly half of each working day with LFortran as part of the 2021 Google Summer of Code under the fortran-lang organization, mentored by Ondrej Certik.

Background As mentioned in an earlier post, I have had the immense pleasure of continuing development of the disruptive lfortran compiler under the aegis of the Fortran Lang organization, financed by the Google Summer of Code and mentored ably by Ondrej Certik. A rather interesting consequence of this is that we are strongly encouraged to write a precis of our activities each week. This is mine, given that the clock starting winding down (full timeline) last Monday.</description></item></channel></rss>
