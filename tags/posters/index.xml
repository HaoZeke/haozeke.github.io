Background I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been in an in-person conference for quite a long while now. There were multiple things going for SciPyCon. Collaborators at UT Austin (from the EON project). The prospect of meeting folks from Quansight. Meeting other members of the NumPy community I&amp;rsquo;d been working with virtually for a year. I had the pleasure of being the recipient of a SciPy Scholarship for my poster and conference proceeding on Wailord, which sealed the deal for me.</description></item></channel></rss>
