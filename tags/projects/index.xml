Background For most of my emacs configuration1, there normally isn&amp;rsquo;t very much to write about which isn&amp;rsquo;t immediately evident from my configuration site. However, since my shift to a MacBook, I have needed to fine tune my existing lsp-mode default setup for TRAMP and this post will cover a little bit of that. Though most of the post is about doom-emacs, it is also applicable to vanilla emacs after porting the snippets over to use-package instead.</description></item><item><title>HPC Configuration 2021</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/hpc-conf-2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 May 2021 23:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/hpc-conf-2021/</guid><description>A post on configuring a user account for heavy interactive HPC usage with Spack, Nix and self-hosted applications.
Background I have in the past written a few posts about configuring my HPC setup. Since the Research and University Network of Iceland hf. (RHnet) recently recieved funding for a new machine, called Elja 1, I decided to jot down my notes from my setup as part of the user interaction team.</description></item><item><title>Anki Decks with Orgmode</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/anki-decks-orgmode/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2020 01:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/anki-decks-orgmode/</guid><description>Setting up unicode math and orgmode for painless Anki deck building
Background A recent Hacker News post reminded me of Anki, and that brought back memories of my Anki orgmode setup. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d re-create and immortalize it.
The standard way of working with Anki, is with a pretty awkward GUI. There are changes to be made here, which make life a little easier, including the setup of custom cards, but the inherent concerns of the WYSIWYG editor are basically insurmountable.</description></item><item><title>Local Nix without Root</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/local-nix-no-root/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/local-nix-no-root/</guid><description>Monkeying around with nix for HPC systems which have no root access and NFS filesystems.
Background Nix is not well known for being friendly to users without root access. This is typically made worse by the &amp;ldquo;exotic&amp;rdquo; filesystem attributes common to HPC networks (this also plagues hermes). An earlier post details how and why proot failed. The short pitch is simply:
Figure 1: Does your HPC look like this?</description></item><item><title>HPC Dotfiles and LMod</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/hpc-dots-lmod/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2020 02:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/hpc-dots-lmod/</guid><description>Background My move away from the powerful, but unimaginatively named HPC clusters of IITK 1 brought me in close contact with the Lua based 2 lmod module system. Rather than fall into the rabbit hole of brew we will leverage the existing system to add our new libraries. Not finding any good collections of these composable environments, and having failed once before to install Nix as a user without admin access, I decided to start my own collection of Lmod recipies.</description></item><item><title>Provisioning Dotfiles on an HPC</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/prov-dots/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/prov-dots/</guid><description>Background My dotfiles turned 4 years old a few months ago (since 9th Jan 2017) and remains one of my most frequently updated projects for obvious reasons. Going through the changes reminds me of a whole of posts I never got around to writing.
Anyway, recently I gained access to another HPC cluster, with a standard configuration (bash, old CentOS) and decided to track my provisioning steps. This is really a very streamlined experience by now, since I&amp;rsquo;ve used the same setup across scores of machines.</description></item></channel></rss>
