Background No one gets very far working with stock one-size fits all tools in any discipline but it is especially true of working with computers. The right set of dotfiles have been compared to priming spells for invocation later, and this is probably true.

Background I have, in the past written about how I made the switch to Colemak. However, until recently, I was still trying to mimic the VIM keybindings from QWERTY. This is a post where I discuss the changes I made to ensure that I never have to stretch my fingers in odd ways again. The main idea is expressed well by vim-colemak.</description></item></channel></rss>
