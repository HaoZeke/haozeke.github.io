Background Rumors of my affiliation with Quansight Labs are indeed true. I have had the pleasure of joining the Labs division as a software engineerÂ 1, whose philosophy is fantastically and succintly described by their director Dr. Ralf Gommers.

A reasonable question.</description></item><item><title>Fortran, GSoC21 and Me</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/fortran-gsoc-me/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 05:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/fortran-gsoc-me/</guid><description>Reminisces and prophecies brought upon by LFortran and GSoC 2021

This post is a little belated, given that the GSoC announcements were a few days ago. Therein lies the future, and much digital ink, sweat and blood shall be spilled towards accomplishing the goals outlined in my accepted project proposal.</description></item></channel></rss>
