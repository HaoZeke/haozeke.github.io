Background This is my third post on working with nixpkgs and R.
Part I covered ways of working effectively with R and nixpkgs Part II dealt with composing dependent devtools packages in a per-package environment, with a focus on rethinking and tidybayes.rethinking This final part is about automating the system-wide configuration using emacs.</description></item><item><title>Statistical Rethinking and Nix</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/rethinking-r-nix/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 04:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/rethinking-r-nix/</guid><description>This post describes how to set up a transparent automated setup for reproducible R workflows using nixpkgs, niv, and lorri. The explanatory example used throughout the post is one of setting up the rethinking package and running some examples from the excellent second edition of &amp;ldquo;Statistical Rethinking&amp;rdquo; by Richard McElreath.
Background As detailed in an earlier post1, I had set up Nix to work with non-CRAN packages.

In particular, there is an emphasis on extensions for installing and working with packages not in CRAN, i.e. packages off Github which are normally installed with devtools.
Background The entire nix ecosystem is fantastic, and is the main packaging system used by d-SEAMS as well.
