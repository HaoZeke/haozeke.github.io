Unfortunately, the standard approach to work with this in nix deals with the local nixpkgs mechanism for python dependencies:
nix-shell -p &amp;#34;python38.withPackages(ps: [ ps.numpy ps.sh ])&amp;#34; However there is a catch for packages which are not officially present upstream.
# Fails! nix-shell -p &amp;#34;python38.withPackages(ps: [ ps.numpy ps.sh ps.lieer ])&amp;#34; However, the mach-nix project can indeed be used to work around this, at the cost of a somewhat longer command.</description></item></channel></rss>
