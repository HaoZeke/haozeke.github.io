Background Derived types are easily one of the most visible of the modern Fortran (post-F90) features and are central to object oriented programming paradigms in Fortarn.
For those new to the language, a rough guide to some terminology:
Fortran Closest C/C++ equivalent derived type struct extends type inherited class final destructor not standard conforming undefined behaviour Only the first of these are actually covered in terms of interoperability with C as of the F2018 draft standard.</description></item><item><title>Revisiting Wayland for ArchLinux</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/revisiting-wayland-2021-archlinux/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 18:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/revisiting-wayland-2021-archlinux/</guid><description>Ruminating on wayland and sway for daily use with ArchLinux
Background Many years ago, I found time to make an attempt to switch away from the X11 Window system to Wayland. At the time, I ended up switching back to Xorg, but I did want to revisit it. Since I returned from home recently and was gifted a Gen 6 ThinkPad X1 Carbon, I had a perfect opportunity to do so 1.</description></item><item><title>Exploring ISO_C_BINDING and type-bound procedures</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/iso-c-type-bound-fortran/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 16:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/iso-c-type-bound-fortran/</guid><description>A closer look at the standard Fortran C compatibility layer by exploring objects and linkers
Background Derived types and their interoperability have been covered previously in the context of usage from Python. However, much of the focus of the previous approach revolved around the iso_c_binding intrinsic module. A closer inspection of the functionality provided therein is the first step towards extending beyond the standards to support calling type bound procedures.</description></item><item><title>Simple Fortran Derived Types and Python</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/cython-derivedtype-f2py/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 04:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/cython-derivedtype-f2py/</guid><description>Moving simple Fortran derived types to Python and back via C
Background Object oriented programming has been part of Fortran for longer than I have been alive 1. Fortran has derived types now. They&amp;rsquo;ve been around for around for over three decades. The standards at the same time, have been supporting more and more interoperable operations. Details of these pleasant historical improvements are pretty much the most the Fortran standards committee have managed to date in the 21st century.</description></item><item><title>NumPy, Meson and f2py</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/numpy-meson-f2py/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 05:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/numpy-meson-f2py/</guid><description>Exploring meson for interfacing fortran and python via f2py and standard techniques, with benchmarks.
Background A recent post gauging community interest in f2py brought to light (among other aspects) the fact that the build systems of f2py are rather opaque to the end user. There are good reasons for this, since many of the tools discussed in this post were not around / in any shape to be used during the active development of f2py1.</description></item><item><title>GSoC21 LFortran and Computational Chemistry</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/gsoc21-fin-reprot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 00:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/gsoc21-fin-reprot/</guid><description>Directed recollections of the GSoC21 timeline
Background If the last ten weeks of weekly posts have not made it clear; as a student developer in the Google Summer of Code in the year 2021; I was privileged to work on the LFortran compiler alongside Gagandeep Singh and Thirumalai Shaktivel under the fantastic mentorship of Ondřej Čertík under the Fortran-Lang organization.

Logistics Daily checkins over Zulip Code reviews on Gitlab Met with Ondrej and Thirumalai on Thursday Discussed comments and how to attach them Decided that it would make sense to possibly store the comments in the ASR to make sure that the comments are attached to the right nodes We discussed a set of outputs for the next week and wrap uppolicies It was fun to see some of Thirumalai&amp;rsquo;s work in person!</description></item><item><title>GSoC21 W8: LFortran Refactors, and Compile Time Evaluations</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/gsoc21-w8/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 17:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/gsoc21-w8/</guid><description>Language standardese and implementations
Background Serialized update for the 2021 Google Summer of Code under the fortran-lang organization, mentored by Ondrej Certik.
Logistics Discussed more refactors over MRs and Zulip Overview Intrinsic functions and more bug hunting. A lot of starts in different directions, but I will need to trim these down a bit. A major goal was working through the compile time evaluation of some intrinsic functions.
New Merge Requests Split ast_to_asr An MR started last week, completed and approved this week tiny: Runtime implementation skeleton What will eventually be compiled, hooks into C for now tiny: Compile time implementation The population of value for tiny function calls Draft: Shift runtime intrinsic design Harmonizing the code-base, much of this is cleaning up my own earlier math implementations Draft: expr_value for Kind A WIP MR which will clean up the slightly strange extract_kind function Draft: Implement where construct An MR along the lines of if, related but distinct from Gagandeep&amp;rsquo;s masked optimization WIP Freshly Assigned Issues &amp;ndash;show-asr For larger values A visual glitch in the prettied output Additional Tasks Some of my earlier clean up MRs are beginning to stagnate (CI stuff), will have to catch up on them.</description></item><item><title>GSoC21 W7: LFortran Workflow Basics</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/gsoc21-w7/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 22:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/gsoc21-w7/</guid><description>Revisiting minidftatom and a birds eye view of lfortran

Logistics Met with Ondrej on Tuesday Went over my kind implementation Merged older approved MRs Worked on generating tests Talked about the test methodology in general Most of the tests are better off in their integration form (discussed below) Some aspects of the passes may be tested using the doctest setup Set an additional time to discuss the implementation of assumed length character declarations These are not actually used in any dftatom routines but they are very common for utility functions Met with Ondrej on Thursday Discussed repercussions of backends Better, more explicit ASR rules can stem from not relying on the CPP backend Talked about the number of passes (SRC-&amp;gt;AST-&amp;gt;ASR-&amp;gt;LLVM) Started working on getting the right thing happen when faced with character(len=*) Overview This week also saw an increase in community activities on the Fortran discourse, since the J3 meeting is now underway and user polling 1 is in full swing.</description></item><item><title>GSoC21 W2: LFortran Unraveling</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/gsoc21-w2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 18:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/gsoc21-w2/</guid><description>Delving into language standards and back-ends for lfortran
Background As discussed in a previous post in this series, I have been spending roughly half of each working day with LFortran as part of the 2021 Google Summer of Code under the fortran-lang organization, mentored by Ondrej Certik.
Logistics Some of the meeting points are to be expanded on below.
Met with Ondrej on Tuesday, as discussed previously Talked about language server implementations Looked into rtags and generating a compilation-database Discussed how the C++ concept of having file based units makes this simpler than the Fortran form, which recognizes no file based program units Talked about the status of the different back-ends Discussed LLVM and MLIR, in the context of Flang (the f18 compiler) Also briefly touched upon legacy-flang and historical issues Discussed standardization of the mod-files Decided this is not a good idea, because a lot of build systems expect Fortran compilers to generate .</description></item><item><title>GSoC21 W1: LFortran Kickoff</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/gsoc21-w1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jun 2021 00:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/gsoc21-w1/</guid><description>Charting paths towards concrete lfortran usage
Background As mentioned in an earlier post, I have had the immense pleasure of continuing development of the disruptive lfortran compiler under the aegis of the Fortran Lang organization, financed by the Google Summer of Code and mentored ably by Ondrej Certik. A rather interesting consequence of this is that we are strongly encouraged to write a precis of our activities each week. This is mine, given that the clock starting winding down (full timeline) last Monday.</description></item></channel></rss>
