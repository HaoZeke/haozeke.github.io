Background Object oriented programming has been part of Fortran for longer than I have been aliveÂ 1. Fortran has derived types now. They&amp;rsquo;ve been around for around for over three decades. The standards at the same time, have been supporting more and more interoperable operations. Details of these pleasant historical improvements are pretty much the most the Fortran standards committee have managed to date in the 21st century.</description></item><item><title>NumPy, Meson and f2py</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/numpy-meson-f2py/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 05:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/numpy-meson-f2py/</guid><description>Exploring meson for interfacing fortran and python via f2py and standard techniques, with benchmarks.
Background A recent post gauging community interest in f2py brought to light (among other aspects) the fact that the build systems of f2py are rather opaque to the end user. There are good reasons for this, since many of the tools discussed in this post were not around / in any shape to be used during the active development of f2py1.</description></item></channel></rss>
