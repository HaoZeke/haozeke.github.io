The key concept is arrays and their iterators.

Background Much the same as the rationale behind my other presentation meta-posts, that is:
I would like to preserve questions I would like to collect the video, slides and other miscellaneous stuff in one locationÂ 1 It would be nice to have my own thoughts here afterwards Details Blurb verbatim from the workshop announcement.</description></item><item><title>Publishing Doxygen and Sphinx with Nix and Rake</title><link>/posts/pub-doc-cpp-dox-sph-nix/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 10:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/pub-doc-cpp-dox-sph-nix/</guid><description>Automating documenation deployment with Travis, rake and nix
Background In the previous post we generated documentation using Doxygen with Exhale to handle Sphinx. Now we will clean up the earlier workflow with rake and ensure the environment is reproducible with nix while deploying to Travis CI.

Background My project proposal for documenting Symengine was recently accepted for the Google Summer of Docs initiative. In the past I have been more than happy to document C++ code using only Doxygen (with pretty fantastic results), while keeping example usage separate (d-SEAMS wiki). Though this is still a feasible method, a monolithic multi-project setup might benefit from Sphinx, which is what will be covered.</description></item></channel></rss>
