First a disclaimer. Comments are not enabled for this post. This is very personal, and it is in my online space so I reserve the right to not talk about this. This is not a conversation. It is a protracted comment on recent, disappointing, news about the &amp;ldquo;tech community&amp;rdquo;. It is unlike anything I have normally published; and is hopefully the last time I will publish something like this.</description></item><item><title>Reclaiming Email with Astroid</title><link>/posts/reclaim-email-astroid/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 06:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/reclaim-email-astroid/</guid><description>Migrating Imap, Gmail and Exchange, mail accounts from GUI clients to Astroid
Background Initially, I had planned this post to start with a brief history of the decline of email clients for Linux. That quickly got out of hand, and was therefore spun out into a post of its own (TBD). To keep things brief. Thanks to the incredible ineptitude of the Thunderbird steering committee, I ended up requiring a new mail client.</description></item></channel></rss>
