Unfortunately, the standard approach to work with this in nix deals with the local nixpkgs mechanism for python dependencies:
1nix-shell -p &amp;#34;python38.withPackages(ps: [ ps.numpy ps.sh ])&amp;#34; However there is a catch for packages which are not officially present upstream.
1# Fails! 2nix-shell -p &amp;#34;python38.withPackages(ps: [ ps.numpy ps.sh ps.lieer ])&amp;#34; However, the mach-nix project can indeed be used to work around this, at the cost of a somewhat longer command.</description></item><item><title>Nix, Channels and the NUR</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/nix-channel-nur/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 02:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/nix-channel-nur/</guid><description>A short exploration of multi-user nix and interacting with the Nix User Repository without root
Background For multi-user nix installations 1, the NIX_PATH variable is empty. Here I briefly go over two approaches to mitigate this, one with nix-channel and the other by manual pinning. Note that this post will eventually be superseded for most cases by a better flake workflow.
Channels The idea behind using a channel is essentially that the tar at a particular commit / tag will be downloaded and stored, typically at $HOME/.</description></item><item><title>Overwriting Attributes</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/snippets/nix-collection-overwrite-attrs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2021 03:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/snippets/nix-collection-overwrite-attrs/</guid><description>1doxygen191 = pkgs.doxygen.overrideAttrs (_: rec { 2name = &amp;#34;doxygen-1.9.1&amp;#34;; 3src = pkgs.fetchurl { 4urls = [ 5&amp;#34;mirror://sourceforge/doxygen/${name}.src.tar.gz&amp;#34; # faster, with https, etc. 6&amp;#34;http://doxygen.nl/files/${name}.src.tar.gz&amp;#34; 7]; 8sha256 = &amp;#34;1lcif1qi20gf04qyjrx7x367669g17vz2ilgi4cmamp1whdsxbk7&amp;#34;; 9}; 10});</description></item><item><title>Project Specific Expressions from Nixpkgs for Sphinx documentation</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/nix-prj-spec-doc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 05:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/nix-prj-spec-doc/</guid><description>Short post on making minimal changes to derivations in nixpkgs at a project level using callPackage() along with GH-Actions for deployment of sphinx documentation.
Background As part of my work on the Symengine documentation1, I had originally thought of leveraging nix for reproducible builds for each of the language bindings with GH-Actions. There exists a derivation in the upstream package repository, but it was outdated (v6.0.0 instead of v6.</description></item><item><title>Talk Supplements for NixCon 2020</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/nixcon-in-2020-meta/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Oct 2020 10:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/nixcon-in-2020-meta/</guid><description>A meta-post on my lightning talk at NixCon 2020

Background Nix is not well known for being friendly to users without root access. This is typically made worse by the &amp;ldquo;exotic&amp;rdquo; filesystem attributes common to HPC networks (this also plagues hermes). An earlier post details how and why proot failed. The short pitch is simply:

Background In previous posts, there was a discussion on a ground up approach to adding packages which aren&amp;rsquo;t on the core nixpkgs channels using GitHub or PyPi sources. However, this lacked a way to do so programmatically, and also a way to convert existing python projects.
Python Dependency Management This time, instead of the more pedagogical approach of building packages from PyPi or GitHub, we will use overlays and the excellent mach-nix to speed up the process.</description></item><item><title>Nix Shells for Node Projects</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/nix-shell-node/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 10:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/nix-shell-node/</guid><description>Background As a prelude to writing up the details of how this site is generated, I realized I should write up a nix oriented workflow for node packages.
Tooling and Idea The basic concepts are:
Use npm to generate a package-lock.json file Use node2nix in a shell to generate a set of nix derivations Enter a shell environment with the nix inputs Profit However, the nuances of this are a bit annoying at first.</description></item><item><title>A Tutorial Introduction to Nix</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/ccon-tut-nix/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2020 16:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/ccon-tut-nix/</guid><description>Brief introduction to a nix based project workflow.
Background For CarpentryCon@Home 2020, along with Amrita Goswami, I am to prepare and deliver a workshop on &amp;ldquo;Reproducible Environments with the Nix Packaging System&amp;rdquo;. In particular, as a community of practice lesson, the focus is not on packaging (as is typical of most Nix tutorials) nor on the Nix expression language itself, but instead on the use of Nix as a replacement for virtual environments using mkShell.</description></item><item><title>Emacs for Nix-R</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/emacs-nix-r/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 00:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/emacs-nix-r/</guid><description>A short post on my current set-up for R with nixpkgs and emacs to auto-compile my system configuration.
Background This is my third post on working with nixpkgs and R.
Part I covered ways of working effectively with R and nixpkgs Part II dealt with composing dependent devtools packages in a per-package environment, with a focus on rethinking and tidybayes.rethinking This final part is about automating the system-wide configuration using emacs.</description></item><item><title>Statistical Rethinking and Nix</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/rethinking-r-nix/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 04:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/rethinking-r-nix/</guid><description>This post describes how to set up a transparent automated setup for reproducible R workflows using nixpkgs, niv, and lorri. The explanatory example used throughout the post is one of setting up the rethinking package and running some examples from the excellent second edition of &amp;ldquo;Statistical Rethinking&amp;rdquo; by Richard McElreath.
Background As detailed in an earlier post1, I had set up Nix to work with non-CRAN packages. If the rest of this section is unclear, please refer back to the earlier post.</description></item><item><title>Nix with R and devtools</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/nix-r-devtools/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2020 05:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/nix-r-devtools/</guid><description>This post discusses briefly, the nix-shell environment for reproducible programming. In particular, there is an emphasis on extensions for installing and working with packages not in CRAN, i.e. packages off Github which are normally installed with devtools.
Background The entire nix ecosystem is fantastic, and is the main packaging system used by d-SEAMS as well. Recently I began working through the excellent second edition of &amp;ldquo;Statistical Rethinking&amp;rdquo; by Richard McElreath1.</description></item></channel></rss>
