Background Recently I decided that it was annoying for me as a user to not know which links on my site were internal and which led off to an external site.
Figure 1: The desired end-result, blue for internal links, purple for external links, colors chosen with ColorHexa
However, since hugo requires baseurl for generating meaningful rss and sitemap files, this meant either hardcoding the variable into my theme, or figuring out how to pass variables from my config.</description></item><item><title>Talk Supplements for IOP CAPS'21 Webdev Workshop</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/iop-caps-webdev-2021-meta/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 10:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/iop-caps-webdev-2021-meta/</guid><description>A meta-post on the workshop I held for the IOP CAPS'21 student conference on Web Development for Physicists

Background A few days ago I recieved the following email:
Hi there!
I made some changes to the GoatCounter plans/pricing:
GoatCounter now has a &amp;ldquo;Starter&amp;rdquo; plan, this is €5/month, limited to 100k pageviews/month, comes with a custom domain, and allow commercial use. This is mostly the same as the &amp;ldquo;personal plus&amp;rdquo; plan there was before, except that it allows commercial use.</description></item><item><title>Analytics: Google to Goat</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/goat-google/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 17:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/goat-google/</guid><description>Background Like a lot of my tech based rants, this was brought on by a recent Hacker News post. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into why the product listed there is a hollow faux FOSS rip-off. I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss how the &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; analytics option, like many others are just hobby projects taking pot shots at other projects. Or how insanely overpriced most alternatives are.
I will however discuss why and how I transitioned to using the awesome Goat Counter.</description></item></channel></rss>
