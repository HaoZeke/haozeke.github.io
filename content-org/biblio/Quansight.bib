  abstract = {There is a widely available object-oriented (OO) programming language that is usually overlooked in the OO Analysis, OO Design, OO Programming literature. It was designed with most of the features of languages like C++, Eiffel, and Smalltalk. It has extensive and efficient numerical abilities including concise array and matrix handling, like Matlab\textregistered. In addition, it is readily extended to massively parallel machines and is backed by an international ISO and ANSI standard. The language is Fortran 90 (and Fortran 95).},

This essay is a C programmer's reaction to the call to abandon ship. It questions several aspects commonly held to define the experience of using C; these include unsafety, undefined behaviour, and the motivation of performance. It argues all these are in fact inessential; rather, it traces C's ultimate strength to a communicative design which cannot be understood within the usual conception of "a programming language", but can be seen as the antithesis of so-called "managed" languages. This communicativity is understood as facilitating the essential aspect of system-building: creating parts which interact with other remote parts---being "alongside" not "within", and of "alien" origin.},

In particular, we consider the consequences of using pointers when implementing a formally specified ADT in Fortran 90. Our aim is to highlight the resulting conflict between the goal of information hiding, which is central to the ADT methodology, and the space efficiency of the implementation. We show that the issue of storage recovery cannot be avoided by the ADT user, and present a range of implementations of a simple ADT to illustrate various approaches towards satisfactory storage management. Finally, we propose a set of guidelines for implementing ADTs using pointers in Fortran 90. These guidelines offer a way gracefully to provide disposal operations in Fortran 90. Such an approach is desirable since Fortran 90 does not provide automatic garbage collection which is offered by many object-oriented languages including Eiffel, Java, Smalltalk, and Simula.},

  abstract = {Chasm is a toolkit providing seamless language interoperability between Fortran 95 and C++. Language interoperability is important to scientific programmers because scientific applications are predominantly written in Fortran, while software tools are mostly written in C++. Two design features differentiate Chasm from other related tools. First, we avoid the common-denominator type systems and programming models found in most Interface Definition Language (IDL)-based interoperability systems. Chasm uses the intermediate representation generated by a compiler front-end for each supported language as its source of interface information instead of an IDL. Second, bridging code is generated for each pairwise language binding, removing the need for a common intermediate data representation and multiple levels of indirection between the caller and callee. These features make Chasm a simple system that performs well, requires minimal user intervention and, in most instances, bridging code generation can be performed automatically. Chasm is also easily extensible and highly portable. Copyright c 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
