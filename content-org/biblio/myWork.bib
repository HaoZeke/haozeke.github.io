  abstract = {Structural analyses are an integral part of computational research on nucleation and supercooled water, whose accuracy and efficiency can impact the validity and feasibility of such studies. The underlying molecular mechanisms of these often elusive and computationally expensive processes can be inferred from the evolution of ice-like structures, determined using appropriate structural analysis techniques. We present d-SEAMS, a free and open-source postprocessing engine for the analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories, which is specifically able to qualitatively classify ice structures in both strong-confinement and bulk systems. For the first time, recent algorithms for confined ice structure determination have been implemented, along with topological network criteria for bulk ice structure determination. We also propose and validate a new order parameter for identifying the building blocks of quasi-one-dimensional ice. Recognizing the need for customization in structural analysis, d-SEAMS has a unique code architecture built with nix and employing a YAML-Lua scripting pipeline. The software has been designed to be userfriendly and extensible. The engine outputs are compatible with popular graphics software suites, allowing for immediate visual insights into the systems studied. We demonstrate the features of d-SEAMS by using it to analyze nucleation in the bulk regime and for quasi-one- and quasi-two-dimensional systems. Structural time evolution and quantitative metrics are determined for heterogeneous ice nucleation on a silver-exposed β-AgI surface, homogeneous ice nucleation, flat monolayer square ice formation, and freezing of an ice nanotube.},

High Performance Computing cluster (HPC) bottlenecks and installation barriers are also discussed and mitigation strategies are developed. As a concrete example we demonstrate the estimation of a phylogenetic tree, used to pose and answer questions on evolutionary lineages. In this manner, a generalized approach which can be used for systems biology is elucidated for manipulating phylogenetic data, including its validation, multiple sequence alignment, tree estimation through different models and reproduction.},

Here we discuss existing methods of package management, including those which have been developed with scalability in mind, and enumerate the drawbacks and advantages of each management methodology. We contrast the paradigms of containerization via docker, virtualization via KVM, pod-infrastructures via Kubernetes, and specialized HPC packaging systems via Spack and identify key areas of neglect. We demonstrate how functional programming due to reliance on immutable states has been leveraged for deterministic package management via the nix-language expressions. We show its associated ecosystem is a prime candidate for HPC package management. We further develop guidelines and identify bottlenecks in the existing structure and present the methodology by which the nix ecosystem should be developed further as an optimal tool for HPC package management. We assert that the caveats of the nix ecosystem can easily mitigated by considerations relevant only to HPC systems, without compromising on functional methodology and features of the nix-language. We show that benefits of adoption in terms of generating reproducible derivations in a secure manner allow for workflows to be scaled across heterogeneous clusters. In particular, from the implementation hurdles faced during the compilation and running of the d-SEAMS scientific software engine, distributed as a nix-derivation on an HPC cluster, we identify communication protocols for working with SLURM and TORQUE user resource allocation queues. These protocols are heuristically defined and described in terms of the reference implementation required for queue-efficient nix builds.},

  abstract = {Any optimization alogrithm programming interface can be seen as a black-box function with additional free parameters. In this spirit, simulated annealing (SA) can be implemented in pseudo-code within the dimensions of single slide with free parameters relating to the annealing schedule. Such an implementation however, neglects necessarily much of the structure necessary to take advantage of advances in computing resources, and algorithmic breakthroughs. Simulated annealing is often introduced in myriad disciplines, from discrete examples like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to molecular cluster potential energy exploration or even explorations of a protein's configurational space. Theoretical guarantees also demand a stricter structure in terms of statistical quantities, which cannot simply be left to the user. We will introduce several standard paradigms and demonstrate how these can be "lifted" into a unified framework using object oriented programming in Python. We demonstrate how clean, interoperable, reproducible programming libraries can be used to access and rapidly iterate on variants of Simulated Annealing in a manner which can be extended to serve as a best practices blueprint or design pattern for a data-driven optimization library.},

  abstract = {As the global health crisis unfolded, many academic conferences moved online in 2020. This move has been hailed as a positive step towards inclusivity in its attenuation of economic, physical, and legal barriers and effectively enabled many individuals from groups that have traditionally been underrepresented to join and participate. A number of studies have outlined how moving online made it possible to gather a more global community and has increased opportunities for individuals with various constraints, e.g., caregiving responsibilities.Yet, the mere existence of online conferences is no guarantee that everyone can attend and participate meaningfully. In fact, many elements of an online conference are still significant barriers to truly diverse participation: the tools used can be inaccessible for some individuals; the scheduling choices can favour some geographical locations; the set-up of the conference can provide more visibility to well-established researchers and reduce opportunities for early-career researchers. While acknowledging the benefits of an online setting, especially for individuals who have traditionally been underrepresented or excluded, we recognize that fostering social justice requires inclusivity to actively be centered in every aspect of online conference design.Here, we draw from the literature and from our own experiences to identify practices that purposefully encourage a diverse community to attend, participate in, and lead online conferences. Reflecting on how to design more inclusive online events is especially important as multiple scientific organizations have announced that they will continue offering an online version of their event when in-person conferences can resume.}

  abstract = {In this work, we have considered the crystallisation behaviour of supercooled water in the presence of surface defects of varying size (surface fraction, α from 1 to 0.5). Ice nucleation on Ag exposed βAgI (0001 plane) surface is investigated by molecular dynamics simulation at a temperature of 240 K. For systems with α {$>$} 0.67, the surface layers crystallise within 150 ns. In the system with defects, we observe two distinct stacking patterns in the layers near the surface and find that systems with AA stacking cause a monotonic decrease in the early nucleation dynamics with an increase in defect size. Where AB stacking (α = 0.833) is observed, the effect of the defect is diminished and the dynamics are similar to the plain AgI surface. This is supported by the variation in the orientational dynamics, hydrogen bond network stability, and tetrahedrality with respect to the defects. We quantify results in terms of the network topology using double-diamond cages (DDCs) and hexagonal cages (HCs). The configurations of the initially formed layers of ice strongly affect the subsequent growth even at long timescales. We assert that the retarded ice growth due to defects can be explained by the relative increase in DDCs with respect to HCs.},

  abstract = {We computationally investigate the dynamics of a self-propelled Janus probe in crowded environments. The crowding is caused by the presence of viscoelastic polymers or non- viscoelastic disconnected monomers. Our simulations show that the translational, as well as rotational mean square displacements, have a distinctive three-step growth for fixed values of self-propulsion force, and steadily increase with self-propulsion, irrespective of the nature of the crowder. On the other hand, in the absence of crowders, the rotational dynamics of the Janus probe is independent of self-propulsion force. On replacing the repulsive polymers with sticky ones, translational and rotational mean square displacements of the Janus probe show a sharp drop. Since different faces of a Janus particle interact differently with the environment, we show that the direction of self-propulsion also affects its dynamics. The ratio of long-time translational and rotational diffusivities of the self-propelled probe with a fixed self-propulsion, when plotted against the area fraction of the crowders, passes through a minima and at higher area fraction merges to its value in the absence of the crowder. This points towards the decoupling of translational and rotational dynamics of the self-propelled probe at intermediate area fraction of the crowders. However, such translational-rotational decoupling is absent for passive probes.},
