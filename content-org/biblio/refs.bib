  abstract        = {Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple
                  versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated
                  predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions when
                  predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when
                  predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making
                  bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as
                  new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using
                  classification and regression trees and subset selection in
                  linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains
                  in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the
                  prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause
                  significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging
                  can improve accuracy.},
