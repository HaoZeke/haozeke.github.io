  abstract        = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo has proven a remarkable empirical
                  success, but only recently have we begun to develop a rigorous
                  understanding of why it performs so well on difficult problems
                  and how it is best applied in practice. Unfortunately, that
                  understanding is confined within the mathematics of
                  differential geometry which has limited its dissemination,
                  especially to the applied communities for which it is
                  particularly important. In this review I provide a
                  comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical
                  foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition
                  behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of
                  any exhaustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a
                  statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a solid grasp
                  of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works, when it succeeds, and,
                  perhaps most importantly, when it fails.},

  abstract        = {Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple
                  versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated
                  predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions when
                  predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when
                  predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making
                  bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as
                  new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using
                  classification and regression trees and subset selection in
                  linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains
                  in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the
                  prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause
                  significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging
                  can improve accuracy.},
